## Install from the app market

Rainbond proposes an application model called Rainbond Application Model (RAM), which is the standard Rainbond application specification.Based on this model and Rainbond's app market mechanism, one-click installation/upgrade is ultimately achieved.The highly automated delivery experience enhances the efficiency of enterprise application delivery and reduces delivery costs.

The app market provided by Rainbond is divided into two categories:

**1. Local component library**

:::info

The local component library is the app market that comes with Rainbond. All application templates you publish under this enterprise can be stored here.Other users within the enterprise can quickly replicate this application by installing the application template from the local component library.

:::

**2. Open source app store**

:::info

The open source app store is an app market officially supported by Goodrain Technology. All Rainbond can connect to this market and install the applications on it with one click.

:::

The main difference between the local component library and the cloud app market is that the applications you publish in the local component library can only circulate in the deployed Rainbond environment.Applications published to the cloud app market can be installed with one click in multiple Rainbond environments.
