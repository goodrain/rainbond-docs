This tutorial will demonstrate some of the core capabilities of Rainbond:

- **Source Code Build**: Automatically recognize Java Maven language, complete automated deployment from source code to operation.
- **Application Market Ecosystem**: One-click installation of standardized middleware to achieve production-level availability.
- **Component Assembly**: Visually establish service dependencies, automatically inject environment variables and connection information.

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Rainbond Quick Installation](/docs/quick-start/quick-install).

## 1. Deploy Java Maven Service via Source Code

### üöÄ Highlights

- **Zero Configuration Build**: Automatically recognize `pom.xml` file, complete the entire process from dependency download->compile and package->containerized build
- **Multi-Environment Adaptation**: Automatically detect ARM/x86 architecture, match the corresponding base image

### üß© Operation Process

1. **Create Application and Component**
    1. Enter the target team view ‚û°Ô∏è Create a new application.
    2. Select to build from source code ‚û°Ô∏è Source code.
        - Customize the application name.
        - Repository address: `https://gitee.com/rainbond/java-maven-demo.git`.
        - Branch: `master`.

2. **Intelligent Parsing Process**
    - Automatically parse the corresponding language type based on the project files, such as if there is a `pom.xml` file in the project, automatically determine it as `Java-Maven`.
    - Automatically parse the Maven build command based on the `pom.xml` file.

3. **Deployment Monitoring**
    - View real-time logs of source code build in the component's overview ‚û°Ô∏è Operation records.
        builder: [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS # Source code compilation completed
        pushing manifest for goodrain.me/xxx done # Image build completed
    - Verify running status (green)
4. **Access Verification**
    - Automatically generate access domain name rules, `<componentID>-<port>-<NS>-<cluster root domain>`, such as: `gr6f8fd7-5000-default-192.168.1.11.nip.io`.
    - Component ‚û°Ô∏è Port view, use the automatically generated **domain name** to access the sample page.

## 2. Install MySQL Service via Application Market

### üöÄ Highlights

- **Out-of-the-Box Use**: Pre-configured resource limits, persistent storage, health checks, and other production-level parameters.
- **Localization Adaptation**: Automatically select the MySQL image that matches the current cluster architecture (ARM/x86).

### üß© Operation Process

1. **Install Middleware**
    1. Add component ‚û°Ô∏è Select external application market.
    2. Search for MySQL and install version 8.0.

2. **Intelligent Configuration Instructions**
    - Automatically create PVC and mount it to `/var/lib/mysql`.
    - Automatically generate root password and store it in component connection information.
3. **Status Check**
    - If the component status is green, it means the deployment is successful.
4. **Access Management**
    - Component ‚û°Ô∏è Port view, enable the **external service** switch.
    - Automatically generate access policies, click to view MySQL connection information, such as address, account password, etc.

## 3) Establish Communication Between Services

### üöÄ Highlights

- **Automatic Injection of Environment Variables**: Dynamically inject environment variables to achieve dynamic resolution between services.
- **Inter-Service Communication**: Automatically create internal service domain names to achieve internal service access using domain names.

### üß© Operation Process

1. **Topology Diagram Editing**
    1. Enter the application view ‚û°Ô∏è Topology diagram editing mode.
    2. Drag Java Maven ‚û°Ô∏è MySQL to establish a connection.

2. **Dependency Effect Verification (Command Line)**
    - Enter the `Java` component's web terminal, execute:
    ```bash
        env | grep MYSQL_HOST
        curl ${MYSQL_HOST}:${MYSQL_PORT}
    ```
3. **Dependency Effect Verification (Browser)**
    - Access the Java service instance page, and enter the MySQL example page.
    - Confirm the display of MySQL connection information and database tables, etc.

:::info
After establishing the dependency relationship between services, restart the dependent component to ensure the environment variables are correctly injected.
