This section focuses on how applications are managed in the application market, mainly including applications on the upboard, app description, packages and versions, and the generation of offline packages.`Administrator` roles will have more management features.

## Manage app information

On the Marketplace, log in, click on the upper right corner `console` to enter the background administration`, select the left `top right` to place the app`. When you see an app that has been posted from Rainbond, click `Admin `will go to the application management interface to complete the application information, and the Tabs will contain `basic', `App Version`, `Package Manager\`.

Once the message is edited, it will appear in the app version list.

### Edit Package Version

### Listing

An app can be searched from the shop's home page to an application that is listed. Once you click on the app details page, you can see the author of the publishing app. If you generate an offline pack, you will display a `download` button. Click the download to get an installation package from the current app. This package can be imported by others into the Rainbod platform to manage the process reference[使用指南](/docs/store/install/apppackage).

### Apply Versioning

Version naming specifications are usually in the form of "Main Version.Subversion.Revision".

1. Main version：indicates a major update or reconfiguration of the software, usually decided by the developer or company.When the software is significantly updated or reconfigured, the master version number should be recounted from 1.

2. Minor version：indicates that software features are enhanced or modified, usually by developer or company.The secondary version should be reset to 0 when the software is significantly updated or reformed.

3. Revision number：indicates that bug fixes or minor improvements to the software are usually determined by the developer or tester.For each bug fix or minor improvement, the revision number should be added.

For example, a software version number 1.2.3, in which 1 denotes the main version, 2 indicates the sub-version and 3 indicates the revised number.

In addition to this, the version naming specification needs to follow the master：

1. The different parts of the version number are separated by a point number (.), without other symbols.
2. Version number should be a string and should not contain any spaces or other special characters.
3. Version numbers should follow the incremental rule from left to right, i.e. the main version number is higher than the sub-version and the sub-version is higher than the revision number.
4. Version number should be unique. No version number is allowed.

It is important to note that the Rainbod App Store does not have a version feature and needs to be set up when it is ready and posted to the Open Source App Store.

### Package management norms

Package management is a set of management standards for applications or service providers designed to regulate the naming, price, content, timeliness, etc. of packages to provide better user experience and quality of services.

**The package name：** should have a clear and concise name that expresses the content and value of the package.The name should correspond to the actual content of the package and avoid misleading or confusing.It is suggested that the words should be added at the end of the paragraph.

**Package price：** should be clear, transparent, and fair.Prices should be based on the actual value of the package and market demand, avoiding unreasonable price increases or reductions.
