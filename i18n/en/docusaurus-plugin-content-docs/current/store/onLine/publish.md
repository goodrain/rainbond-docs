This section focuses on how developed applications can be released to the App Store. The applications are in fact stored in the App Market by packing the Applied Metadata into the Application Template, which defines the Standard Cloud Native Application Models that support the Large Digital Business Systems, which can include 1-N service components, including each service component resource and configuration, plugin resources and configurations, pop relationships, deployments, etc.Once produced, one click is published, one click is installed.

## App Publishing Process

在应用发布之前，你需要有一个正常运行的应用，我们可以在应用视图看到它的拓扑图以及运行状态，具体操作如下：

- **First step**：is on the App Popup page, click on the Left Navigation Bar `, select `Publish to the Cloud App Store\`, then select the Open Source Store and confirm.
- **Step 2**：is on the release page and you can refine the app's details, such as `App template name', `Version Node', `Version description', `Component Configuration\`.
- **Step 3**：will launch sync tasks by clicking `Submit` after you have completed app details.Synchronize data for each service in the app by cluster.Publish to the `cloud store`, the data center will synchronize the image or source package required for the app to the rain public repository and send the application template to the `Open Source Store`.
- **Step 4**：will complete the app release when all components and plugins in the app are synced.

After the release has been completed, Rainbond can see the release record, after the application market is logged in, see the application version and manage it accordingly.Next you need to apply `listing` to make your app visible and available to others.App Marketplace Management and Listing Apps Reference[文档](/docs/store/onLine/putaway).
