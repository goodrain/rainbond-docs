This article introduces the troubleshooting ideas encountered in the process of building components through Rainbond.

## build process

![](https://static.goodrain.com/docs/5.12/troubleshooting/installation/en-build-process.png)

Building the Rainbond source code is divided into the following steps:

1. Pull project source code
2. Start the Job task in the 'rbd system' namespace
3. 运行 Job 任务，该任务镜像会从私有镜像仓库获取。
4. Package project code, such as Vue project, and execute npm install, npm run build to package static files.
5. Through [Kaniko]（ https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko ）Create a container image.
6. 推送镜像到私有镜像仓库。
7. Successfully run.

## common problem

Users' use of Rainbond starts with deploying service components. We call this process build. The source of construction includes image, source code and application market. The most problematic of these methods is the construction method from mirror or source code.构建的来源包括镜像、源码和应用市场。这几种方式中容易出现问题的是来自镜像或源码的构建方式。

The `rbd-chaos` component in Rainbond is specially used to build service components. Troubleshooting of this part often requires the use of commands to query its logs to obtain information.

```bash
kubectl logs -f -l name=rbd-chaos -n rbd-system
```

You can also view the logs through the console **Platform Management -> Logs -> Cluster Logs -> Build Logs**.

### The build cannot be pulled to the mirror, prompting ImagePullBackOff

#### The containerd private mirror warehouse certificate is not configured

Usually use the kubectl describe command to view detailed error reports. If the error is `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`, it is likely that the default image warehouse certificate of Rainbond is not trusted. If your environment is Containerd, you need to modify the containerd configuration file of each node and configure the goodrain.me private warehouse. Then restart containerd.如果你的环境是 Containerd，那么需要修改每个节点的 containerd 配置文件，配置 goodrain.me 私有仓库。然后重启 containerd。

1. Modify the configuration file `/etc/containerd/config.toml`

```
[plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".registry.configs]
  [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".registry.configs."goodrain.me"]
    [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".registry.configs."goodrain.me".tls]
       insecure_skip_verify = true
```

2. Modify the configuration file `/etc/containerd/certs.d/goodrain.me/hosts.toml`

```
[host."https://goodrain.me"]
  capabilities = ["pull", "resolve","push"]
  skip_verify = true
```

3. Restart the containerd of each node

#### The version of the private mirror warehouse is too low

If the `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority` error occurs in the stand-alone trial version (the default version of the stand-alone trial version is Containerd, and the certificate is also configured by default), then it is likely that the version of the private mirror warehouse is too low, and the registry needs to be upgraded to the latest version .

```bash
# Enter the rainbow-allinone container
$ docker exec -it rainbond-allinone bash

# Upgrade rbd-hub version
$ kubectl edit rbdcomponent rbd-hub -n rbd-system

spec:
  image: registry:2 # Get the latest version of the registry image from DockerHub
```

#### The builder image in the private warehouse is missing

If there is no build log for a long time after you click to start building, check the rbd-chaos log and find an error `Back-off pulling image "goodrain.me/builder"`, it means that the builder image in the private warehouse is lost and the build task cannot be run. At this point, you only need to manually pull the image from the public network and push it to the private warehouse. In addition to the builder image, the component operation also requires a runner image, which can be processed here. The main operation steps are as follows:除了 builder 镜像外，组件运行还需要 runner 镜像，可以在此一并处理。主要操作步骤有以下三步：

1. Pull the builder and runner images to the local, and replace the image tag
2. Obtain the password of the private warehouse account and log in
3. Push the image to the private warehouse

1. Pull image and change tag

```bash
nerdctl -n k8s.io image pull registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/goodrain/builder:v5.17.3-release
nerdctl -n k8s.io image pull registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/goodrain/runner:v5.17.3-release

nerdctl -n k8s.io image tag registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/goodrain/builder:v5.17.3-release goodrain.me/builder:latest
nerdctl -n k8s.io image tag registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/goodrain/runner:v5.17.3-release goodrain.me/runner:latest
```

2. Obtain the password of the private warehouse account and log in

```bash
# Obtain account and password
kubectl get rainbondcluster -nrbd-system -oyaml |grep imageHub -A3
# Login to private warehouse
nerdctl -n k8s.io login --username=admin goodrain.me
```

3. Push the image to a private repository

```bash
nerdctl -n k8s.io image push goodrain.me/builder:latest --insecure-registry
nerdctl -n k8s.io image push goodrain.me/runner:latest --insecure-registry
```

docker tag registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/goodrain/builder:v5.17.3-release goodrain.me/builder:latest
docker tag registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/goodrain/runner:v5.17.3-release goodrain.me/runner:latest
```

2. Obtain the password of the private warehouse account and log in

```bash
# Obtain account and password
kubectl get rainbondcluster -nrbd-system -oyaml |grep imageHub -A3
# Login to private warehouse
docker login goodrain.me -uadmin
```

3. Push the image to a private repository

```bash
docker push goodrain.me/builder:latest
docker push goodrain.me/runner:latest
```

### Component build source detection failed

Component build source detection failed. Possible causes of this problem include:

- The image address is filled incorrectly. For example, some images do not provide the `arm64` version, so Rainbond installed in the `arm64` environment cannot normally obtain the corresponding image.
- The mirror warehouse needs to fill in the user name and password to log in.
- If the above information is checked and correct, then query the rbd-chaos component log.

#### Which images cannot be run directly on Rainbond.

- Basic operating system images, such as `CentOS` `Ubuntu` `alpine` cannot run directly on Rainbond.
- Basic languages ​​& tools, such as golang compilation environment, docker compilation environment, maven compilation environment and other images cannot be run directly on Rainbond.

### Node.js Frequently asked questions about front-end project construction

The Node.js language can be used not only to build front-end projects such as Vue, but also to build server-side projects. Both of these usages are supported in the Rainbond source build world, however building a front-end project as a server-side project won't work properly. Pay attention to the build source page of the service component. The language column shows `NodeJSStatic`, which can prove that the NodeJS front-end project is being built.
It's important to note this: Rainbond recognizes a NodeJS front-end class project based on the existence of `package.json` and `nodestatic.json` files in the root of the source code.
If it is found that the build has become the wrong type, after adding the specified file and submitting the code, click `Recheck` on the build source page, and build again.根据经验，此处遭遇的问题也是最多的。

Many users build and deploy [NodeJS front-end projects](/docs/use-manual/component-create/language-support/nodejs-static) on Rainbond, such as Vue, React, etc. According to experience, the problems encountered here are also the most.
The error message of building the NodeJS front-end project may come from the prompt on the page, or it may be prompted in the log on the right side of the build failure record.

#### source code is recognized as Node.js instead of NodeJSStatic

Node.js 语言不仅可以用于构建 Vue 等前端项目，也可以构建服务端项目。这两种使用方法在 Rainbond 源码构建领域中都得到支持，然而将前端项目构建成服务端项目是无法正常运行的。关注服务组件的构建源页面，语言一栏显示为 `NodeJSStatic` 能够证明构建的是 NodeJS 前端项目。

务必注意这一点：Rainbond 会根据源代码根目录是否有 `package.json` 和 `nodestatic.json` 文件来识别为 NodeJS 前端类项目。

如果发现构建成为了错误的类型，添加指定文件并提交代码后，点击构建源页面中的 `重新检测`，并再次构建。

#### No yarn.lock or package-lock.json file found in code directory, must generate and submit yarn.lock or package-lock.json file

Rainbond decides which build tool to use to build static files by identifying the `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json` file in the source directory. So one (and only one) of the above files must exist.
After submitting the corresponding file, rebuild it.所以上述文件必须存在一个（且只能存在一个）。

提交对应文件后，重新构建即可。

#### Two different lockfiles found: package-lock.json and yarn.lock

This message indicates that there are two lock files `package-lock.json` and `yarn.json` in the root directory of the current source code. Please delete the other lock file according to the package manager you want to use, and rebuild after submitting the code.

#### Outdated Yarn lockfile

This information indicates that the yarn.lock used for the current build conflicts with the version dependencies specified in package.json. According to the subsequent prompts in the build log, you can update yarn.lock locally and rebuild after submitting the code.

#### SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token

This message indicates that the npm version specified in the `engines` section in the current `package.json` conflicts with the node version selected in the build source. Delete all the contents of the `engines` section in `package.json`, resubmit and build.删除 `package.json` 中 `engines` 段落的所有内容，重新提交后构建即可。

### The source code build cannot obtain the private mirror warehouse

For example, when using Dockerfile for source code construction, the FROM in the Dockerfile is the address of the private mirror warehouse, and you need to configure the private mirror warehouse address, account and password in **Team View -> Management -> Mirror Warehouse Authorization Information**.
