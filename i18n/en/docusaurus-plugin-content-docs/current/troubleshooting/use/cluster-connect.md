This article introduces the troubleshooting ideas for abnormal communication between the Rainbond console and the cluster.

## The cluster communication is abnormal or the cluster end loses response

![](https://static.goodrain.com/docs/5.12/troubleshooting/installation/en-cluster-connect.png)

Rainbond is divided into two layers, the console and the cluster. The console communicates with the cluster through the API. If the communication between the console and the cluster is abnormal, the console cannot be used normally.

There may be the following reasons for the exception:

1. The network between the console and the cluster is disconnected.
2. The API service on the cluster side is unavailable.
3. The API service on the cluster side is blocked by the firewall.

## Troubleshoot ideas

If such problems occur, you can troubleshoot according to the following troubleshooting ideas.

### Check the network between the console and the cluster

First, check the log of the console, go to **Platform Management -> Log -> Console Log** of the console, if `https://192.168.1.1:8443 time out` appears, it means that the console and the cluster end network issue.

You can enter the terminal of the console and use the `ping` command to check whether the network between the console and the cluster is smooth.

If the network is disconnected, you can check whether the console and the cluster network are in the same network segment. If not, you can configure the routing table for network communication.

### Check cluster-side API services

If the network between the console and the cluster side is smooth, and the `8443` port is smooth, you can check whether the API service on the cluster side is normal.

Use the following command to check whether the API service is normal:

```bash
kubectl get pod -l name=rbd-api -n rbd-system
```

If the API is abnormal, you can view the logs of the API service through the following command:

```bash
kubectl logs -fl name=rbd-api -n rbd-system
```

Check according to the error information in the log.

Or try restarting the API service:

```bash
kubectl delete pod -l name=rbd-api -n rbd-system
```

### Check console and cluster ports

If the network between the console and the cluster is smooth and the API service is normal, you can check whether the ports `8443` on the console and the cluster are unblocked. Use the `telnet` command to check whether the port `8443` on the console and the cluster side is unblocked.

If it fails, you can check whether the `8443` port on the cluster side is blocked by the firewall. If it is blocked by the firewall, you can configure the firewall rules for port communication.

## common problem

### remote error: tls: error decrypting message

Viewing the log of the rbd-api service shows the following error:

```bash
http: TLS handshake error from 10.42.0.1:35590: remote error: tls: error decrypting message
```

The reason for this error is that the certificate of the API service on the cluster side is inconsistent with that of the console, which makes the console unable to communicate with the API service on the cluster side.

You can view the cluster connection information through the [grctl config](/docs/ops-guide/tools/grctl) command.

```bash
$ grctl config
apiAddress: https://47.104.161.96:8443
ca.pem: |
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  xxxxx
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
client.key.pem: |
  -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
  xxxxx
  -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
client.pem: |
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  xxxxxx
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```
Copy the printed content to **Platform Management -> Cluster -> Edit** in the console, and click **Save**.
* apiAddress corresponds to **API address**
* ca.pem corresponds to **API-CA certificate**
* client.pem corresponds to **API-Client certificate**
* client.key.pem corresponds to **API-Client certificate key**

:::caution Caution
There cannot be spaces on the left and right sides of the certificate, otherwise the certificate will not be recognized.
:::

If it is determined that the certificate of the console is consistent with the certificate of the cluster, but the problem still occurs, you can try to regenerate the certificate of the cluster.

```bash
# Delete the certificate on the cluster side
kubectl delete secret rbd-api-client-cert rbd-api-server-cert -n rbd-system

# Restart the operator to regenerate the cluster-side certificate
kubectl delete pod -l release=rainbond-operator -n rbd-system

# Restart the api service
kubectl delete pod -l name=rbd-api -n rbd-system
```

After the operator is restarted, the cluster-side certificate will be regenerated, and the cluster information can be obtained through `grctl config` again and copied to the cluster console.
