description: Install Rainbond from Linux based on the graphical interface
keywords:
- 基于主机安装 Rainbond
---

In the current installation mode, users are guided to install Rainbond from a bare metal server, which can be a physical machine, virtual machine, or various cloud hosts.

During the installation process, the graphical console is started with a command, and then the entire Rainbond cluster is installed based on the graphical interface.

## Precondition

### Operating system requirements

|Supported operating systems|Minimum requirements (per node)|
| :----- | :----- |
|**CentOS** 7.x，8.x |CPU：2，Internal storage：4G，Disk：50GB+|
|**CentOS Stream** 8，9 |CPU：2，Internal storage：4G，Disk：50GB+|
|**Ubuntu** 16.x，18.x，20.x，22.x |CPU：2，Internal storage：4G，Disk：50GB+|
|**Debian** 9.x，10.x，11.x |CPU：2，Internal storage：4G，Disk：50GB+|
|**Anolis OS** 7.x，8.x |CPU：2，Internal storage：4G，Disk：50GB+|

### Network requirement

The IP address of the server cannot be in the private network segment 169.254.0.0/16. This address segment is reserved for Link-Local and is usually used to automatically assign IP addresses in the absence of a DHCP server. In this case, Kubernetes may assume that the server does not have a proper network connection, causing the installation to fail.

### Other requirements

| core | OpenSSH | Node port                  |
| ---- | ------- | ------------------------- |
| 4.0+ | 7.0+    | 80，443，6060，7070，8443 |

:::tip

The installation mode supports Linux x86 and Arm64 operating systems, and supports [localization and innovation].(/docs/localization-guide).

:::

## Deploy the Rainbond console

:::info

The Rainbond console runs on Linux, Windows(Docker Desktop), or Mac(Docker Desktop).

:::

Install Docker using the script provided by Rainbond.

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.rainbond.com/install_docker | bash
```

#### Start the All-In-One console

```bash
docker run -d -p 7070:7070 \
--name=rainbond-allinone --restart=always \
-v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh \
-v ~/rainbonddata:/app/data \
registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/goodrain/rainbond:v5.17.0-release-allinone
```

:::info

The console will generate data that needs to be persisted, stored in the '~/rainbonddata' directory of your deployment node.

:::

### Start with the host

1. After login, go to **Platform Management > Cluster -> Add Cluster -> Install from Host** The GUI installation page is displayed.

2. Fill in node information

   - The current Aliyun server has an external IP address. If the server does not have an external IP address in private deployment, the IP address and Intranet IP address **must be entered as the server IP address**.

   - The current demonstration cluster is 3 nodes, Kubernetes properties ETCD, management, computing properties multiplexed, in self-deployment **according to their own plannin** select node properties.

3. After the node information is filled in, run the replication node initialization command on **all nodes** in the cluster as prompted.

4. After the initialization is complete, click **Next**, wait until the Kubernetes cluster is installed successfully, and proceed to the next step when the state is **Running**

5. After checking **I have read and clearly understand the above precautions**, click 'Start initialization' and wait for the installation to complete.
   * During the Rainbond installation and deployment process, you can customize cluster initialization parameters and configure them on the cluster initialization platform page. For details, refer to the document [High Availability Installation](/docs/installation/ha-deployment/deploy-rainbond/init-rainbond-config)。

## Next step

- [quick start](/docs/quick-start/getting-started/): Quickly deploy your first application on Rainbond.
- [migrate applications](/docs/ops-guide/migrate-app): You can refer to this document to migrate standalone applications to this Kubernetes cluster.
