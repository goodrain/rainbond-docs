import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Overview

The current installation method can quickly experience the full functionality of Rainbond by running only one container. Only applicable to experience Rainbond functions or personal development environment. Support `Windows`、`MacOS`、`Linux` operating systems, And `x86_64` 、`Arm64` Mainstream Architecture.

## Pre

:::caution
1. Install Docker
2. Memory greater than 2G, 4G or above recommended
3. Disk 50G or above recommended
4. Open ports 80 443 6060 6443 7070 8443
:::

## Deployment process

:::info
The next steps will guide you to get Rainbond running quickly on your machine
:::

<Tabs groupId="install">
  <TabItem value="Linux" label="Linux" default>

<h3>1. Install Docker</h3>

```bash
curl sh.rainbond.com/install_docker | bash
```

<h3>2. Set EIP(Required)</h3>

**You need to specify an IP address, After deployment is complete, This IP address will be used to access the Rainbond. The IP is set through the env `EIP`.**

**This address can be the public IP or intranet IP on the deployment machine. The IP address can be obtained by running the `ifconfig` command.**

:::caution
When you fill in the intranet IP，eg: 192.168.3.25, May be inaccessible after switching network environments. So if you only test the experience locally, You can fill in the local loopback address.
eg: `export EIP=127.0.0.1`
:::

```bash
export EIP=<Your IP ADDR>
```

<h3>3. Install Rainbond</h3>

```bash
docker run --privileged -d -p 7070:7070 -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 6060:6060 -p 8443:8443 \
--name=rainbond-allinone --restart=on-failure \
-v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh \
-v ~/rainbonddata:/app/data \
-v /opt/rainbond:/opt/rainbond \
-v ~/dockerdata:/var/lib/docker \
-e EIP=$EIP \
rainbond/rainbond:v5.8.1-dind-allinone \
&& docker logs -f rainbond-allinone
```

**After executing the above command, wait patiently for 5-10 minutes, You can see the following log output, indicating that Rainbond has been started.**
