import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Overview

The current installation method can quickly experience the full functionality of Rainbond by running only one container. Only applicable to experience Rainbond functions or personal development environment. Support `Windows`、`MacOS`、`Linux` operating systems, And `x86_64` 、`Arm64` Mainstream Architecture.

## Pre

:::caution
1. Install Docker
2. Memory greater than 2G, 4G or above recommended
3. Disk 50G or above recommended
4. Open ports 80 443 6060 6443 7070 8443
:::

## Deployment process

:::info
The next steps will guide you to get Rainbond running quickly on your machine
:::

<Tabs groupId="install">
  <TabItem value="Linux" label="Linux" default>

<h3>1. Install Docker</h3>

```bash
curl sh.rainbond.com/install_docker | bash
```

<h3>2. Set EIP(NotNecessary)</h3>

**You need to specify an IP address, After deployment is complete, This IP address will be used to access the Rainbond. The IP is set through the env `EIP`.**

**This address can be the public IP or intranet IP on the deployment machine. The IP address can be obtained by running the `ifconfig` command.**

:::caution
When you fill in the intranet IP，eg: 192.168.3.25, May be inaccessible after switching network environments. So if you only test the experience locally, You can fill in the local loopback address.
eg: `export EIP=127.0.0.1`
:::

```bash
export EIP=<Your IP ADDR>
```

<h3>3. Install Rainbond</h3>

```bash
docker run --privileged -d -p 7070:7070 -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 6060:6060 -p 8443:8443 \
--name=rainbond-allinone --restart=on-failure \
-v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh \
-v ~/rainbonddata:/app/data \
-v /opt/rainbond:/opt/rainbond \
-e EIP=$EIP \
rainbond/rainbond:v5.9.0-dind-allinone \
&& docker logs -f rainbond-allinone
```

**After executing the above command, wait patiently for 5-10 minutes, You can see the following log output, indicating that Rainbond has been started.**

Since the Windows environment variable setting is different from other methods, we do not set the environment variable in the terminal. Instead, when starting Rainbond in the third step, modify the EIP environment variable in the startup command.
eg: `-e EIP=127.0.0.1`
