## Overview

The main purpose of the global log is to help developers and operators better understand and analyse application log data in order to diagnose and solve problems more quickly.

### Main features

Global log main uses include monitoring applications, debugging and troubleshooting, security audits, optimizing application performance, etc.

#### Monitor App

- By displaying application logs, developers can help monitor application performance and behaviour, such as request delays, throughput, error rates, etc.These indicators can help developers identify potential problems in a timely manner and address them.

#### Debug and troubleshooting

- Global logs can help developers quickly identify and position errors and anomalies in their applications in order to perform troubleshooting fasterFor example, developers can use Grafana to display recent error logs in order to identify which components or services are problematic.

#### Security audit

- Global logs can help security teams monitor the security of applications, such as checking if there are unauthorized access attempts, unusual requests, etc.By displaying application logs, Grafana helps the security team better understand the behavior of the application and detect potential security problems.

#### Optimize application performance

- By displaying application logs, developers can be helped to identify performance bottlenecks and bottlenecks in applications in order to optimize application performance.
