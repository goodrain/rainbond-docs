## What is Link Tracker

Link tracking is a distributed tracking technique that records a call process for requests in distributed systems so that developers can have a clear understanding of the path of a request in the system and the performance of each service node.Linked tracking technologies can help developers with problems in rapid positioning systems and improve system availability and stability.

## How to track using links

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
