### Prometheus-based custom monitoring

Since the V5.3 version, Rainbond has added the custom business monitoring function, which supports users to realize the custom business monitoring based on Prometheus through the custom Exporter plug-in.This operation requires users to have a relatively systematic understanding of the Prometheus monitoring system.

### MySQLD Exporter

As an example, Rainbond V5.3 comes with MySQLD Exporter plug-in after installation, which is based on the standard MySQLD Exporter implementation.The Prometheus monitoring system rbd-monitor that comes with Rainbond will collect the data in the Exporter and display it through the monitoring panel.

#### Plugin installation

Click the **Plug-in** tab to **activate the** MySQLD Exporter plug-in.

![Install the MySQLD Exporter plugin](https://static.goodrain.com/docs/5.3/component-op/custom-monitor/custom-monitor-1.png)

After the plug-in is activated, check the configuration to confirm whether the**(MySQL connection information) is correct.

![Confirm configuration](https://static.goodrain.com/docs/5.3/component-op/custom-monitor/custom-monitor-2.png)

After confirming that it is correct, update the Mysql service component according to the prompt **, and you can start to collect the indicators provided by MySQLD Exporter.

#### View monitoring

This plug-in has been configured with common monitoring charts by default, and you can view them directly.

Click **monitoring** - **business monitoring** in turn to see the corresponding monitoring chart：

|    Monitoring item     |
|:----------------------:|
|       slow query       |
|          OPS           |
|     Disk read rate     |
|    Disk write rate     |
|   Byte receive rate    |
|     Byte send rate     |
| InnoDB cache pool size |
| connection thread peak |
|  running thread peak   |
| Average running thread |
|  Table Lock lmmediate  |
|   Table Lock Waited    |

#### Manage monitoring points

By clicking the **management monitoring point** in the upper right of the business monitoring panel, you can define monitoring point information, which defines the source of monitoring indicators.

The MySQLD Exporter plugin has defined a set of monitoring point configurations. This set of configurations includes the following elements, all of which are required：

- Configuration name：Customize the name of this group of configurations

- Collect task name：custom

- The source path of the path：indicator, according to the exporter design, you need to fill in the appropriate path

- port：The port on which the Exporter listens

- Collection interval： how often to collect metrics

Multiple groups of configurations can be added to monitoring points, and users need to configure them according to their own designed Exporter.


#### Add monitoring chart

If we want to add a monitoring chart to show the current number of connections to the database, then please follow the steps below to：

Click **above the business monitoring panel to add chart**

After entering the new title and the corresponding query condition `mysql_global_status_threads_connected` , click **to query**.If the chart is returned normally, the query conditions are correct.The definition of the title should be as clear and concise as possible, and the unit should be specified where necessary.

![Add monitoring chart](https://static.goodrain.com/docs/5.3/component-op/custom-monitor/custom-monitor-4.png)

After clicking **to add** , the new monitoring chart can be added to the business monitoring panel.The newly added monitoring chart will be placed last.

Access the port 9104 of the Mysql service component, and you can view all the monitoring items available for graphing under the /metrics path.


### Custom monitoring for other types of business

For JAVA applications built from source code, we integrate exporter in the construction process, and its usage refers to best practices： [Custom monitoring for JAVA applications](https://www.rainbond.com/blog/JmxExporter)
