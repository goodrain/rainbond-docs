title: Advanced environment variable configuration
description: Rainbond's advanced usage of environment variables is suitable for developers to refer to, so that applications can effectively interact with the platform.
---

The operating environment of the component will inject some useful environmental variables by default, in addition to the environment variables set by the user itself.In addition, some new features of a experimental nature may be based on setting up special environmental variables on their opening or settings.In addition to the environment variables set by the user, the platform also injects some useful environment variables by default.In addition, some experimental new features may also be enabled or set based on setting special environment variables.Therefore, understanding Rainbond's default environment variable mechanism can enable developers to develop more efficiently in many scenarios, and can also produce applications that are more suitable for Rainbond to run.

### Default injected environment variables

> Generally, the relevant variables are injected according to the relevant properties of the component, so as to facilitate the developer to obtain the information related to the component.

- The relationship between the component instance memory setting size and the value of the MEMORY_SIZE environment variable

  > It is very beneficial for the program to obtain the memory size set by the current component, such as Java's JVM configuration, PHP's fpm configuration, etc. Some internal middleware that needs to set memory should preferably be coordinated with the memory settings of the component itself, otherwise OOM or memory waste may occur. Case.

* Description of environment variables for automatic domain name injection:

The application defaults to inject the current component's access domain name environment variable information：DOMIAN and DOMAIN_PROTOCOL. If the component has multiple ports, the injection strategy is as follows

If there are multiple ports,`_ port number`will be added after the environment variable name, that is,`DOMAIN_ port number`For example: DOMAIN_80, DOMAIN_8080

The corresponding domain name protocol is DOMAIN_PROTOCOL_80

2.DOMIN variable value is the value of the component port number from small to larger, the custom domain name.The value of the DOMIAN variable is the component port number from small to large, and the custom domain name takes precedence.For example, there are ports 80 and 8080. If 8080 is bound with a custom domain name, the value of DOMIAN is the custom domain name of port 8080.If no custom domain name is bound, it is the default domain name of port 80.Default domain name for 80 ports if none are bound to a custom domain.

### Variables used when building the component

Environment variables whose variable names start with`BUILD_`take effect in the construction phase of the source code construction class application, such as the following variable：

| variable name                                                                        | variable                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | illustrate                                   |

### Efficient use of environment variables for software configuration

The third point of the 12 elements of cloud native applications："Code and configuration are strictly separated, configuration must be completely separated from code, and different environments share a set of code.It is recommended to store application configuration in environment variables".It is recommended that the parts of your program that need to be configured be as variable as possible in the environment.| memory/Mb | environment variable value | | ------- | ---------- | | 128 | micro | | 256 | small | | 512 | medium | | 1024 | large | | 2048 | 2xlarge | | 4096 | 4xlarge | | 8192 | 8xlarge | | 16384 | 16xlarge | | 32768 | |It is recommended to quantify those parts of your program that need to be configured as much as possible.
