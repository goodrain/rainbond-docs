This paper gives you a clearer understanding of the concept of the app by describing the properties and terms associated with the app.

### Service Component Status

Once a service component is created, it enters the service component lifecycle and has a series of states throughout the life cycle, each of which is explained below.多数状态预设了超时时间，无论是否超时，在 **3 分钟** 后，都可以对服务组件重新进行全部生命周期操作：：

| Status                                        | Note                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

First service component build is in progress.Source build timeout of 1 hour, Dockerfile build timeout of 30 minutes.**Timeout does not mean build failure** and reference build logs to see current progress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| <font color="#ffa940">Scheduler</font>        | Once the service component is constructed, it enters the state of the schedule,**the instance color is yellow**.This process is performed by K8s to assign the instance to the host.If this status is maintained for a long time, it may be because there is no host node to run the component.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| <font color="#ffa940">Waiting to start</font> | Wait for startup and startup will not appear simultaneously, **Instance colors are yellow** once they are on startup.Note that other service components on which the current service component relies have not been started.You need to wait for the other service components on which you depend to start before the current service component enters the active state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| <font color="red">Running exception</font>    | The service component runs fewer than the total number of instances that identify the app as an exception,**The exception color is red on**For multiple-instance service components, a service component in an unusual state can provide services as long as there are normal examples.Instances are in most cases due to an abnormal exit of the service component itself or an OOM exit due to insufficient memory.The platform will automatically try to restart an exception instance.More app information can be viewed by viewing service component logs or using command line tools |
