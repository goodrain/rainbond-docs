The gateway access policy under the team will display the policies of the entire team. Unlike the application, the application will only display the relevant gateway policies in the application.

Certificate configuration can only be configured in Team View -> Gateway -> Certificate Management and can be used across the entire team including within the app.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
