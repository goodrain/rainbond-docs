# Learn about Rainbond Creativity

The Rainbond version of the Creativity Scenario, which was produced specifically for the national production of trusts, comprehensively reduces the cost of technology for migration of applications to the Creative Environment and contributes to the zero cost migration of the Creative Creation.Rainbond countries produce IT ecology and have completed compatibility certification with multiple national CPU structures, allowing rapid deployment under different structures.Creativity applications, legacy business systems can provide source code, software packages, container mirrors, etc. Zero cost to move to the home fun environment.At the same time, Rainbond, with its strong cloud management capability, enables users to manage multiple isomer clusters, “One cloud-multich” clusters through a single control platform, making full use of the resources of different cloud platforms and performing high-difficulty operations such as cross-cloud movement and mixing of isomer applications.

The "Confidence Creation" version further expands the functionality of the Cloud Native App Store.Creativity apps can be easily released as an application template for different structures, installing one click in a nationally-produced confidence creation environment.Open source stores also offer hundreds of open source software that can be used under different structures, significantly reducing the cost of software delivery for a domestically produced confidence-building environment.

# Creativity

Rainbond supports the following features in Creativity fields in：

- "A cloud of multiple chires", manage the isomer cluster：

A one-click installation and hosting of the Kubernetes cluster, which in addition to the traditional X86/64 architecture, fully supports the arm64 architecture, unifying the management of nationally produced chips based on the Arm set of instructions, such as the SAP 920 and the Flight.

- Fast migration of traditional apps to FREE：

Source build capacity fully supports the arm64 architecture, and migration of traditional applications to the national production environment without modifying one line of code.Lew Rainbond has an established cloud native management experience and simplify course-management
costs for messenger generation apps.

- Application market mechanism fully supports arm64 architecture：

Users can install an open source app in an open source store that works under the arm64 architecture.Self-released application templates also automatically recognize their architectural properties, which means that users can make their own application templates suitable for installation under the arm64 architecture, reducing the cost of delivery for the fun environment.
