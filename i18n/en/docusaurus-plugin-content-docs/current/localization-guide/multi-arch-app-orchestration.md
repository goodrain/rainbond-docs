# Meaning of isomer microservice organization

Rainbond version of "Trust" with "One cloud of multichit" management capability allows for the integrated movement control of computing nodes of different CPU structures in the same cluster.The service component in the app can also be deployed to the specified structure as required.However, only if the microservices components of the different structures can be structured and communicated, they can become an organic whole and form a complete business system.It also meets the special requirements for the period of transition from traditional `X86_64` to `arm64` countries.

Building on the capacity of the Service Mesh or Kubernetes Service, Rainbond naturally supports the organization and communication between cross-structure microservices.Using methods is not the same as that used by Rainbond to drag and drop wooden microservices.
