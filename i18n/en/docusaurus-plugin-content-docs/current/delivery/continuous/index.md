Continuous delivery is a software development practice whereby systems can automatically prepare for release of code changes to the production environment.

## Distinction between continuous integration and continued delivery

Continuous integration is designed to allow products to quickly iterate, deliver high-quality codes and simplify workflow.Core is that the code must be integrated into the backbone and must pass all automated tests.

The purpose of continued delivery is to deliver high-quality and valuable products.The core is to frequently deliver new versions of the software to the testing team for testing.If test passes, this version can be used as production.

## Focus on continued delivery

The focus of continuous integration is on code, but continued delivery focuses on deliverable products.

Deliverable products must have the required quality to ensure that they are not problematic in the production environment, so complete testing is required after successful and sustained integration.
