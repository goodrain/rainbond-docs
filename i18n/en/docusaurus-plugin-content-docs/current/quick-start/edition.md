| Has a complete application advanced function extension architecture | In addition to its own functions, components can extend other advanced functions without intrusion, such as firewall, log processing, performance analysis, network management, etc. It is very important to establish a standard application plug-in system specification.A plug-in is a program that exists independently and is bound to a component and has the same running environment as the component, and can define the unique configuration information of the plug-in.This document lists the key basic functions of`open source version`With the version upgrade, the list in this document may not be complete.
