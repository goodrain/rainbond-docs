The current installation method allows you to quickly experience the full functionality of Rainbond by running a single container. This version is designed for single-node experiences, suitable for trying out Rainbond features or for personal development environments. It supports Windows (x86_64), Mac (Intel/M1), and Linux (x86_64, Arm64).This version is a one-machine experience version that only works with Rainbond features or personal development environments.Support for `Windows(x86_64)`, `Mac(Intel/M1)`, `Linux(x86_64, Arm64)`.

## Prerequisite

- Install Docker, if docker environment is not present on Linux, it will be automatically installed through a shell script; If you are using macOS, install [Mac Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes/#docker-desktop); If you are using Windows, install [Windows Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)
- Install Windows [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)
- Linux will install Docker via Shell script by default if no Docker environment
- Make sure that ports 80, 443, 6060, 7070, and 8443 are available.

## Installation steps

Rainbond provides an installation script to quickly launch Rainbond within a Docker container. During the script execution, you will be prompted to manually set the EIP (External IP). Once the deployment is complete, you will use this IP address to access the Rainbond console.You need to set the EIP manually while the script is running.Once the deployment has been completed, the IP address will be used to visit the Rainbond Console console.

```bash
curl -o install.sh https://get.rainbond.com && IMGHUB_MIRROR=rainbond bash ./install.sh
```

```

Rainbond provided a one-click installation script and supported the need for a national crystallization by quickly launching Rainbond in the Docker with a container.When the script is executed, the required structure will be automatically selected, and an EIP will be created manually.Once the deployment has been completed, the IP address will be used to visit the Rainbond Console console.

```bash
curl -o install.sh https://get.rainbond.com && cash ./install.sh
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

After executing the aforementioned script, please wait patiently for 3-5 minutes. You will see the following log output, indicating that Rainbond has completed its startup:

```bash
2022-10-11 11:50:38 INFO: Rainbond started successfully, Please pass http://$EIP:7070 Access Rainbond
```

## Next step

Now that you have deployed an available Rainbond platform, you can try the following path to learn more about Rainbond：

**1. [快速入门](/docs/quick-start/getting-started/) -> [部署你自己的应用](/docs/use-manual/) -> > [Deployment of Rainbond](/docs/installation/install-with-ui/#Installation from host) -> [将应用从单机版迁移至集群部署](/docs/ops-guide/migrate-app)**

In this path, you will start starting with a one-machine version.When you visit Rainbond, you can refer to [getting started](/docs/quick-start/getting-started) to use Rainbond.Then you can refer to[用户使用手册](/docs/use-manual/) to deploy your own app and develop and manage it directly on the single version of RainbondLater you can refer to[从主机安装](/docs/installation/install-with-ui/#Install from Host) to deploy the cluster version Rainbond, and manage your cluster with existing applications[迁移](/docs/ops-guide/migrate-app) on a single server.

**2. [快速入门](/docs/quick-start/getting-started/) -> [部署高可用集群](/docs/installation/installation-with-ui/ha) -> [在高可用集群中部署你的应用](/docs/use-manual/)**

In this path, it is still starting from the one-machine version.After you experience Rainbond management through[快速入门](/docs/quick-start/getting-started/), you can refer directly to document[部署高可用集群](/docs/installation/installation-with-ui/ha) and[部署管理你的应用](/docs/use-manual/) in a highly available cluster.

## Extended parameter

By default, `10,000 to 10010` ports have been added to TCP ports for operations.By default, 10 ports from '10000-10010' are added for service TCP ports. If you need more TCP ports, pass the command printed in the script, delete the container restart and add '-p' to map the new port.

## Troubleshooting

**If a single node experience is not installed for a long time, please refer to document [单机体验版本安装问题排查指南](/docs/troubleshooting/installation/dind) for troubleshooting.Or join [微信群](/community/support#microbelieve),[钉钉群](/community/support#pegs) for help.**
