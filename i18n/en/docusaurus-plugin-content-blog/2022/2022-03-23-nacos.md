## The combination of Rainbond and Nacos

[Rainbond](https://www.rainbond.com/?channel=nacos) is an easy-to-use open source cloud-native application management platform.With it, users can complete the deployment and operation and maintenance of microservices in a graphical interface.With the help of the capabilities of Kubernetes and containerization technology, automatic operation and maintenance capabilities such as fault self-healing and elastic scaling can be empowered to users' businesses.

Rainbond has a built-in native Service Mesh microservice framework, and also has a good integration experience with other microservice frameworks such as Spring Cloud and Dubbo.Therefore, a large number of Rainbond users may also be users of the Nacos microservice registry.Such users no longer need to care about how to deploy Nacos clusters. The Rainbond team made Nacos into an application template that can be deployed with one click, which can be downloaded and installed by open source users for free.This installation method greatly reduces the deployment burden of users using Nacos cluster, and currently supports versions 1.4.2 and 2.0.4.


## About Application Templates

The application template is an installation package for the Rainbond cloud-native application management platform. Based on it, users can install business systems into their own Rainbond with one click.No matter how complex the business system is, the application template will abstract it into an application, and install it together with the images, configuration information of all components in the application, and the relationship between all components.

# Preconditions

* **test**

Other microservice components that need to perform service registration can use `${NACOS_HOST}:${NACOS_PORT}` to connect to the Nacos cluster after establishing[dependencies](https://www.rainbond.com/docs/use-manual/user-manual/component-connection/regist_and_discover)for Nacos.

* **service registration**

  ```bash
  curl -X PUT "http://${NACOS_HOST}:${NACOS_PORT}/nacos/v1/ns/instance?serviceName=nacos.naming.serviceName&ip=20.18.7.10&port=8080"
  ```

* **service discovery**

  ```bash
  curl -X GET "http://${NACOS_HOST}:${NACOS_PORT}/nacos/v1/ns/instance/list?serviceName=nacos.naming.serviceName"
  ```

* **publish configuration**

  ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://${NACOS_HOST}:${NACOS_PORT}/nacos/v1/cs/configs?dataId=nacos.cfg.dataId&group=test&content=helloWorld"
  ```

* **get configuration**

  ```bash
  curl -X GET "http://${NACOS_HOST}:${NACOS_PORT}/nacos/v1/cs/configs?dataId=nacos.cfg.dataId&group=test"
  ```

# Advanced Features

- The Nacos cluster installed with one click contains 3 instances, and the operation of self-organization and election is automatically completed by initializing the plug-in.
