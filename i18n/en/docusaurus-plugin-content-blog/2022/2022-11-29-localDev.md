Before you develop, you need to install development tools and services locally such as：Mysql, Redis, Nacos and so on. We all know that installing these services on your personal computer is quite onerous and can encounter many problems, environmental problems, dependency problems, etc.

When team collaborative business interfaces are required, Mac, Win, Linux may also encounter operating system dependence, charset etc. due to a lack of uniformity among colleagues' operating systems.

Until you are online, you have no problem developing debugging locally. Deploy to the server will not work.The classic：is good locally. Now you cannot deploy anymore.

## Benefits of using Rainbond local development

**Deployment**

A new development environment is required for new projects or new teams, a process that will take several hours and will encounter strange problems.It will also take a few hours to build an environment when team collaborates and when new people arrive.Use Rainbond to pack the base environment. New projects and new people come to install, so that we do not waste time in building an environment.

**Unified Environment**

For SMEs, there is not too much cost to support a public development environment.Use Rainbond to develop a uniform environment in which Rainbond, whether Windows or Mac can be installed, and when tested and produced using Rainbond, can directly export packages to test and produce them.

## Locally deploy Rainbond

With Windows, Mac can easily be deployed to Rainbond, just if your environment has Docker Desktop.

**Mac**

> Support deployment on Mac x86 and M1

```bash
curl -o install.sh https://get.rainbond.com && cash ./install.sh
```

**Windows**

```bash
docker run --privileged -d  -p 7070:7070 -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 6060:6060 -p 8443:8443 ^
--name=rainbond-allinone --restart=on-failure ^
-v rainbond-data:/app/data ^
-v rainbond-opt:/opt/rainbond ^
-e EIP=<你的IP地址> ^
registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/goodrain/rainbond:v5.10.0-dind-allinone
```

### Resource Occupation

Build such a cloud native platform locally. Of course, the most important concern is the use of resources.Because the local configuration is usually not very high, my configuration is M1Pro 16G, when Rainbond is deployed, to view resource occupancy in Docker Desktop, as shown below, the total occupancy is modest, CPU occupies 10%, and memory occupancy 1.1GB.

### Base environment creation

You can quickly install the basic environment through Rainbond Open Source Store for services like：Mysql, Redis, ZK, Kafka, ES, Nacos, etc.All can be installed. It is easy and easy.

### Operational deployment and integrated environment

With Rainbond deployed, let us no longer care about what the bottom Docker mirror, how Dockerfile writes, etc. You can deploy successfully on Rainbond and you can do so as well as in testing and production.：is no longer typical. 'Locally can do nothing' anymore.

Use Rainbond to build business locally. It can be deployed in a variety of ways, Jar Warps, source deployments.

### Development modules shared

Many of the modules are common in one project, such as the base environment Mysql, Redis, some user blocks, permissions and so forth, and we put them on the local Rainbond to the Market, where other colleagues need to install them directly before developing their own modules.

App store publishing split into two ways：

1. Publish to internal component library：this way to export app packages to other colleagues to re-import their own environment
2. Publish to Open Source App Store：is stored in an Open Source App Store located in Rainbrond, while other colleagues are pulled down online, but other Open Source users can also install and are not recommended for project privacy.

Publish our deployed apps to the internal component library, app view -> publish -> Publish -> Publish to the component library, access platform management -> Marketplace -> Export apps.Install downloaded packages to other colleagues in their own local environment.

## Last

With Rainbond being very easy to develop locally and insignificant resources and a uniform development of a testing environment, Rainbond can achieve many scenarios, such as the sharing of the modules mentioned above, and the delivery of local development to demonstration, testing and production environments.
