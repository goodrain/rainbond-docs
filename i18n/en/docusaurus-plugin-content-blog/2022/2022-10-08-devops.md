The developers and drivers are two major groups in the IT sector, all of which are involved in the construction of various business systems.DevOps is a new concept that has erupted in recent years and has been misinterpreted by many as “learning a host of new skills by developers (Dev) and thereby mastering what the operator (Ops) should do”.However, the greater the capacity and the greater the responsibility, and when the responsibility for maintaining the stability of the production environment falls on the shoulders of the developers, most programmers have issued a cry [for low DevOps, we developers simply do not want to do it!](https://mp.weixin.q.com/s/ZLIdcZOAAKHl2KvRsxkGA).So how should the experience of DevOs be reached in the cloud of births?It is my view that the platform works to connect these two groups and do their respective domains.

## Disgusting DevOps

First of all, I would very much like you to look at the article mentioned in the introduction [Little DevOps, we developers do not want to do it at all!](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ZLIdcZOAAKl2KvRsxkGA).The article came from a tweet of Emily Freeman who was involved in the Amazon cloud community and looked at many of the remarks and came to a similar conclusion with the title of the article.From the words of most IT practitioners who responded to this tweet, I heard a grief at the experience of this DevOs that imposed responsibility on the developers.

The developers are insensitive to the notion of “who builds and who works” and to the new skills in the field of transport or to include themselves in the ranks of rotary supporters, who are worried about the future of the profession when their job is discharged, and fear the rebranding of the convoy team.

\*\* Development and shipping are indeed two different types of work, with a distinction similar to “car bed and plumber”.\*\*

|               |                             Developer                             |                             VIPs                             |
| :-----------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|    Speciale   |   Development language, development framework, medium, database   | Hardware, operating system, network, storage, virtualization |
|   Daily work  | Understanding need, developing document writing, development code | Install deployment, monitoring, log, troubleshooting, change |
| Culture Label |                          Freedom, Create                          |                 Conservation, responsibility                 |

Some companies believe that a large number of carriers are governed from the forms, and that the “left” of the brain to the developer is DevOps.The gap created in the fields of professional skills and day-to-day work can be filled through the hard work of developers, yet conflict in the field of cultural labelling will be the root cause of developers averting this DevOs' experience.

## DevOs' Reality and Platform Project

In my view, DevOs' real idea is to use software engineering thinking to solve complex and heavy transport problems.Those truly fit to work with DevOs are transportation specialists with some software engineering capability, and here the requirements for operating capability are even more important.

\*\*DevOps Engineers, by designing or selecting a platform product to abstract complex shipping tasks as a productionalized dimension of transport.From this perspective, the developers will be the users of the platform's products and they will be able to operate and maintain applications without understanding the complex infrastructure.The DevOps engineer should be a mobile engineer better aware of developers' needs. \*\*

Having tracked the roots and found the tweet, I learned more about DevOs from the IT industry, from which I found many voices that resonate with me.

> To do so a sign we havet made others intuitive/easy enough for most devs to be able to handle it.
>
> For me, this suggests that we have not yet made the freight forward/simplistic enough for most developers to handle it.
>
> 121

> The "platform" should do the heavy lifting ops, looking a real platform through the ops team (DevOps/are/platform team) is the platform. Devs can then focus on the application level operations of their applications using the knowledge and levels provided by the platform.
>
> The “platform” should be a heavy transport dimension, and when a real platform is not available, it is the platform (DevOps/are/platformTeam).The developer can then use the buttons provided by the platform and leverage the application level to focus on its application.
>
> 121

The trend in the IT industry in recent years has been the continuous upgrading of platform capacity to address the use of complex infrastructure.At first, the program developers need to face a physical server, and in the absence of operational capability, the operator will handle everything related to the server, including the operating system, network configuration, etc.So far, program developers have rarely had to deal with the server, and even many of the programmers I have met do not have any knowledge of the command line and can develop applications for the server.This shift has made programme developers more focused on business code per se, without having to do onerous and frivolous business issues.This shift has been made possible by the development platform project, which is making infrastructure easy and easy.

![1](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/cloud-native-for-dev-ops/cloud-nation-for-dev-ops-1.png)

The primitive nudity age does not develop the dimensions of transport.From the bottom infrastructure to the top level of the business system is handled by the same group of people, a group of former programmers can be called true full-stack engineers.There is no doubt, however, that every developer wants to be able to move away from work and focus more on the code he has developed.

The emergence of a cloud computing age is based on virtual technology, and software definition infrastructure is becoming hot.Through the construction and maintenance of an IaS cloud platform, the carrier pooled the computing resources.The developer is required to apply for a virtual machine that he or she needs to interact with an operating system interface.Dealing with operating systems continues to pose a great challenge to developers. In IT areas, operating systems like an ice hill floating at sea, appear to reveal only the tip of the iceberg but their vast intellectual fields are hidden below sea level.By comparison with the nudity age, developers and carriers are already two distinct groups, and developers can focus most of their efforts on business systems.It is worth mentioning that ownership of the operating system is a veritable area of mobility.

The spillover of container technology and Kuberentes has been a watershed in the cloud calculation.The technological means of defining the software infrastructure have been used to the greatest extent and have become the calibration skills of those who operate at this stage.By building and maintaining a PaS cloud platform, the carrier finally removed the last “mountain” of the operating system from the developers.Developers can concentrate more on business systems, except for their continuing need to learn container technology and Kubernetes and at least how they can learn how to prepare the declaratory configuration documents required by Kubernetes for business systems.Carriers have also acquired the capabilities they want through the PaaS cloud platform, and the container technology and Kubernetes have provided them with a huge boost in resilience, ease of use.

As I moved from time to time, I reached a conclusion that：\*\* in terms of the relationship between the developer and the forwarder, the evolution of the IT field is that the developers continue to fall back on the developers by taking over “extraneous activities” in the eyes of the developers.When liberated, developers can focus more on their own business systems and unleash their creativity.\*\*

Following the trend in the conclusions, the process of liberating developers will never stop.The work of DevOs is to use the developers as a user group to create a “cloud-origin platform” that will make infrastructure accessible to developers.

The endogenous concept of cloud design applications is one that works to the full extent of cloud design, organizing IT personnel in collaboration with each other to build reliable, adaptable, manageable and observable cloud applications with the ultimate goal of improving software delivery efficiency and reducing operational complexity.At a minimum, it is possible to avoid developers from writing complex Kubernetes declaratory files compared to the PaaS platform mentioned above.

## Available open-source products

In the area of Yunnan platforms, a number of projects are already being cultivated.Here I have listed three unique platform products from the cloud native area：[Rancher](https://rancher.com/),[KubeSphere](https://kubesphere.io/),[Rainbond](https://www.rainbond.com/), and the subsequent practical design thinking will also focus on the implementation of existing products.

Of the three open source products, Rancher is the meta-class container management platform, and after joining SUSE, there is a clear feeling of growing strength in the cloud native ecology area and the range of clan fields that Rancher can integrate at all levels is already very rich.Rancher focused on helping the DevOps team face the challenges of operating peacekeeping in multi-cluster situations, and in this sense, Rancher prefers the experience of using those who transport rather than providing greater ease of use to developers.

KubeSphere is the "Container Mixer Clouds for Cloud Native Apps" from the Cycles.In addition to the ability to manage resources within the Kubernetes cluster, the plugin-like ecological extension capability for Kubesphere masters is instantaneous.

Rainbond was produced by the rainy technology of Beijing and was presented as a cloud management platform for ease of use.

## Reduce the difficulty of deploying operations

To be honest, the production of capsules for business systems developed for modern language development is not a very difficult skill.It is undeniable, however, that preponderant IT practitioners continue to attribute mirrors to operator management rather than to developers for their concerns.

Then DevOps engineers need to consider how to deploy business systems directly from the code when developers have no knowledge of the container technology.

In this regard, Heroku is an indisputable pioneer.Heroku is a cloud platform that supports multiple programming languages, the service product.Acquisition by Salesforce.com in 2010. Heroku was developed as one of the largest cloud platforms since June 2007, when it only supported Ruby, but later increased support for Java, Node.js, Scala, Clojure, Python and PHP and Perl.

When using cloud native platforms, developers can simply fill in the repository address in the interface, the corresponding username code, etc. can wait for the code to be built as a mirror, and operate freely in the Kubernetes cloud.

Existing open source products also give some support in this regard：

|                       |                                              Rancher                                             |                                              KubeSphere                                             | Rainbond                                                                                                                             |

| Support Language Type |            Java, GraalVM, Golang, .NetCore, Nodejs, PHP, Ruby, Python            |                                         Java, Nodejs, Python                                        | Java, Golang, .NetCore, Nodejs, PHP, Python, Html static                                                             |
|       Experience      |                             All command line operations, use complex                             | Graphical operations that provide direct code addresses, build output mirrors and deploy operations | Graphics actions that provide code addresses to complete construction and deployment, build parameters configurable and high freedom |

Further design is to integrate the processes of code submission, detection, deployment, etc. into the CI/CD stream line where the developer only needs to submit the code, the subsequent process will automatically trigger completion, generate the detection report and complete the online deployment of the code.And the related third-party toolset is maintained by the DevOps team, and developers can take advantage of this – and use it well.

More comprehensive in this way in KubeSphere by integrating Jenkins to achieve graphically based hydrological configuration, which is friendly to the team that was previously using Jenkin.And this has inherited the high degree of freedom that the Jenkins already has in place, better integrating other third-party CI tools into the process.

Rainbond can also complete part of the pipeline by adding home-made automatic triggers to the construction process.This configuration is simpler to write Jenkinsfile and meets some basic scenarios.However, its outreach and freedom are inadequate, and the third party CI tools available are not sufficiently abundant.

Rancher does not have the capacity to integrate CI in the product, and GitOps is implemented on CD through integration of Fleet projects, using higher thresholds.

This experience also has the advantage that no developer is required to write a well-formatted Kubernetes declaration profile from the beginning to the end.This is undoubtedly a great good for developers, and Kubernetes is a very steep learning curve.Kibernetes implicitly deploys business systems via the yaml declaratory profile where the vast majority of fields are defined as the manifestation of the dimensions of shipping. In other words, the vast majority of field definitions should not be a matter of concern to the developers.

DevOps engineers should seize the pain points that developers use Kubernetes to avoid exposure to complex transport issues.The Yun Native Platform should provide this experience and allow the developer to complete the deployment of the operations system with total ignorance of Kubernetes.In other words, make Kubernetes “transparent” to developers.

In this respect, it was found that Rancher and KubeSphere could deploy their own business components based on the graphical interface, as a result of the experience of the three open source cloud-origin platforms, but that these graphics configurations are just “translators” of yaml declaratory files, and there is a threshold for users who are not familiar with Kubernetes to use them.Rainbond did this very well, and the operation was deployed with less than Kubernetes and friendly to users who were not familiar with Kubernetes.However, the higher the level of product customization, the more difficult it is to follow Kubernetes and the more Kubernetes is constantly introducing new functional features, and the challenge will be to abstract new features into user-friendly.The latest version of Rainbond has introduced a feature of Kubernetes properties, allowing users to edit workloads in yaml form, and also to break your own "ceiling".

## Reduce the difficulty of operating infrastructure

The design of a platform-level software product requires the abstraction of complex and unmanageable technologies that can be easily understood by users.One of the first tasks of the cloud native platform products designed by DevOs engineers is to reduce the threshold for developers using infrastructure.This section focuses on the operational features of developers managing their own business systems.

In terms of storing this, what does developers really care about?

With this concept of storage, we can speak of a set of words like blocks, equipment, document systems, object storage, local disks, disk arrays, NFS, Ceph, etc.These terms are undeniably linked to storage and will indeed be used by various operating systems, but I believe that the vast majority of developers are not interested in them.

As a user, the developer cares only one thing and I am responsible for the business system in which data in the specified directory needs to be kept permanently.

In most cases, the storage scenarios covered by the business system should be simple.In the cloud-origin era, we have even called on developers to develop business systems as “statelessness” as far as possible, i.e. in business systems there are no status data that limit the horizontal expansion of examples, at least between different examples, and data can be shared.Based on this, DevOps engineers can well provide developers with a default storage type that adapts to most scenarios, and NAS type storage provided by cloud manufacturers is a good choice.

The use of complex storage is more visible in the various intermediates called by the operating system, such as the database requiring high-speed and stable block type storage, and in the larger data domains such as the hedge object storage under the \`Save Separation' scenario.In most cases, however, the maintenance of these complex intermediates is not a matter of concern to the developers.They are maintained by specialized operators, who need only access to their addresses.

So in this simple storage scenario, developers can ideally fill out only a directory address that needs to be perpetuated, with cloud native platforms to configure bottom storage.For storage infrastructure operations, developers do not need attention.

![3](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/cloud-native-for-dev-ops/cloud-nation-for-dev-ops-3.png)

Rancher and KubeSphere have a wide range of storage options in terms of their experience because of their product ecology at least Rainbrond, such as Rancher Lab which directly rolled out a lightweight storage solution and integrated the drivers of stored products provided by major public clouds. Rainbond has continued to do well in terms of ease of use and has achieved the above experience of focusing only on the use of the business system sustainment catalogue.However, storage support for NFS types is relatively perfect, and for other types of storage support needs to be self-driven in underlying infrastructure and installed without convenience.

## Applicable models that are easy to understand

In terms of work loading, Kubernetes describe the characteristics of a single component only in abstracto through Deemployment, Statefulset, etc. However, in most cases, the business system developed by the developers will contain several microservice components.The integrated management of the entire business system had become a problem.One of the solutions is the abstract application of this concept over a single component through the cloud native application platform.The application should consist of an artificially defined set of service components (workload), with explicit or implicit linkages between service components, and an organic mix of each other to provide services externally as a complete business system.

The experience will undoubtedly be simpler and easier for the developers to manage all service components as a whole rather than as a stand-alone service component.The management of applications could include unified life cycle management, uniform installation upgrades uninstallation, flexible spelling service modules call relationships, and more rational business system delivery processes.

Currently, the more mature delivery tool Helm in Kubernetes arena, designed to hide such models, a simple `helm install xxx` command, installing a host of components and configuration around them.

![4](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/cloud-native-for-dev-ops/cloud-nation-for-dev-ops-4.png)

Rancher did not implement his own application model, his app installation integrated Helm and did not reflect app management capability.

KubeSphere went further and the application concept was introduced in the application load under the project.Microservice governance, version control of individual components, routing management, grayscale releases, etc. can be integrated in the app through Helm or self-built services.Its support to the Helm template allows it to theoretically support the installation of any existing Helm Chart kit deployment on any market.

The application concept of Rainbond is the most perfect, and in addition to conventional capabilities such as routine life-cycle operations and the whole application level version control, there are some highly useful self-research features that can simplify the management of developers of their own applications.For example, external service domain names based on a general resolution of domain names mechanism. Click on an external service to generate a publicly available domain name to access their apps, which is far easier than one layer of configuration progress rules.For example, the copying capacity of the app can be copied in bulk to another workspace without having to recreate a set manually.

Application templates are both a concept proposed by KubeSphere and Rainbond and the significance of applying templates is that developed applications can be copied into different settings, a technology that prepares and delivers a new generation of products.The basic usage experience of the application template is the fast and easy installation of the entire application system, preferably a one-tap experience. Both KubeSphere and Rainbond provide the store for users to quickly install some of the developed application templates.The application template is used at a higher level and the developers can develop their own application templates without any technical burden, rather than simply picking others from the app store.

## Microservice architecture that is easily controlled

Microservice structures are also an essential element of the cloud native platform.The micro-service architecture is designed to help developers build modern high-class polymer, low-coupling applications that will split the old chimney-style business system architecture into a host of more independent microservice modules with their own functional features.The maturity of the containers with the associated set-up techniques provides the basis for the location of the microservice architecture.The Cloud Native Application Platform offers the possibility of a simpler start microservice framework for developers.

The preferred microservice framework for the cloud native platform should be the Service Mesh Microservice Framework represented by Istio and Linkerd and also referred to as the “Service Gate”.This microservice framework provides greater freedom and adaptability to Spring Cloud and Dubbo so that developers do not need to be bound by a development language or product, but simply reconnect their business systems as a whole by returning to network programming.The emphasis here is on the fact that the micro-service architecture is inintrusive into business codes, and that only if it is achieved without intrusion will minimize the likelihood that developers will spend their energies on learning knowledge in other areas.

DevOps engineers can further optimize the experience of configuring microservices by designing cloud native platform functionality, assuming that developers can only create microservice profiles by dragging a line between the two service components.Such an operational experience can well block developers from the complex concepts of registration centers, control of plane and micro-service fields.Essentially, maintenance of the registration center or control of the plane is also a work of concern to the operators.

![5](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/cloud-native-for-dev-ops/cloud-nation-for-dev-ops-5.png)

Rancher does not have any microservices-related capabilities in the product because of its own positioning, and users need to manually install micro-service frameworks like Istio and use a complex yaml configuration to refer to microservices.

Both KubeSphere and Rainbond have integrated the Service Mesh Microservice Framework by default at the application level, with the former having integrated the Istio programme, while the latter's Service Mesh Microservice Framework is self-developed.In terms of experience, KubeSphere has been packaged with Istio, significantly reducing Istio's experience, but this does not mean that users can drop out of the Istio layer of concept and apply the internal topography to reflect it using a pre-configured configuration.It is astonishing that Rainbond has become more user-friendly and that a dragged microservice spelling model has been implemented.However, there are too many wheels on its own and other external programmes that want to integrate quickly when they have good characteristics, require that other ecological combinations be based on them rather than on a self-development framework at the interface level of the microservices norm.Rainbond also now offers an integrated approach that accepts Istio governance mode but has not yet been validated by a large number of users.

## Good for Vitors

Previous discussions have been focused on developers as audiences, but we should not forget those who work normally on the underlying infrastructure.The stable operation of any software is only temporary, and the problem is just a matter of time.The Yun Native Platform itself, as the infrastructure of developers, also needs to be maintained on a continuous basis.How to optimize the management experience of personnel involved in transportation is also a priority in the design of the Yun native platform.

In today’s times, the use and maintenance of Kubernetes and the packaging techniques have become the hallmark skills of transport workers, and the control of operating systems and the use of command-line tools is the home of the operator.So there is no need for cloud native platforms to consider too much ease of use or graphical in the design of freight forwarders, much more so in terms of reliability, safety, and ecological compatibility of the underlying infrastructure.

![6](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/cloud-native-for-dev-ops/cloud-nation-for-dev-ops-6.png)

Rancher performed very well at the level of shipping.Thanks to its rich peripheral ecology, Rancher received native support in various fields from his own other products.The first of these is a number of kubernetes distributions by RKE/RKE2/K3S, reducing installation difficulties in Kubernetes in different scenarios.The NeuVector Container Security Platform is responsible for managing the entire life cycle.In infrastructure, there is a lightweight distribution block equipment storage system Longhorn.In addition to the rich ecology, the Rancher product interfaces are designed in particular to meet the preferences of the operators.Kubectl Shell is considered amazing during the personal experience. This is a split-screen command-line interface that can be used to navigate the Vitors by clicking on commands in the next half split screen Shell interactive pages, and observing the results in real time on the top half of the screen.

KubeSphere is also better suited for the maintenance and management of convoys.Especially at the level of MCS alerts, KubeSphere has a good experience in producing a large number of observable charts that meet its product philosophy.The control of clusters or nodes has also been mapped out to facilitate the control of traffic.On the ecological front, KubeSphere is also constantly developing its own cloud-origin project, using home-driven cloud platforms, cloud storage, and load equilibrium.Its built-in plug-in component management system can quickly expand other capabilities at the platform level.

Rainbond was less friendly to the convoy and was even a “forgotten” design concept.The experience revealed that all shipping operations still require login servers.No graphical or command line interfaces are provided to operate clusters and nodes.For multiple clusters, the ability to graphically install the Kubernetes cluster and then install Rainbond is a good experience.The product ecology is not rich enough by Rancher and many other cloud-origin ecological products are officially supported by many documentation.For example, provide documentation on how to install cloud infrastructure like Aliyun ACK, Huawei YunCCE and Tencent TKE.

In the area of user permissions management, Rancher and KubeSphere follow the Kubernetes RBAC, Rainbond is still somewhat singular, and the competency management system does not fully match the original Kubernetes RBAC design, and even when Rainbond is used, the existence of the RAC system is not felt at all.When connecting to an external identity management system, KubeSphere main tweets the LDAP protocol while Rainbond uses the Oauth2.0 protocol.

Others, such as stabilization, conduct audit, and surveillance of police products, have been achieved with little distinction.

## Write in the last

I would prefer to find experts in different fields to identify problems in their respective fields in relation to the recruitment of talented “all-stack” developers for all IT services.In the area of freight services, building and maintaining a fully functional cloud native platform would better address IT business system issues from bottom infrastructure to development processes and eventually to production online.This is a place where DevOps is more legitimate.

The different implementations of the three cloud native platform products, Rancher, KubeSphere and Rainbond were highlighted.

Collectively, Rancher is more biased in favour of the movement of defenders to manage the various Kubernetes infrastructure within the enterprise.For developers to use Rancher well, they must have Kubernetes operating capabilities and packaging techniques.In this sense, Rancher should be positioned between PaaS and the cloud native platform.

Both KubeSphere and Rainbond belong to an application-centred cloud platform product and are ideologically different in design thinking. KubeSphere uses other projects in the cloud-origin field with plug frames, linking them together to provide a one-stop experience for end-users. However, such use experience is necessarily a threshold and every one included in the project, it is inevitable that end-users need to learn from the project and KubeSphere themselves.The design thinking of Rainbond is more internal, and most functions are self-researched.This has the advantage of a highly self-contained functional system, a very good experience of end-users and a better human mindset in which interfunctional interconnection is easier to define itself and increases the threshold for inclusion in other cloud-origin ecosystems.

The DevOps team can directly select the existing cloud native platform level products or can be redeveloped based on open source projects.The preferred option would be to co-deploy many of these elements, to take the lead and take the example of the three products mentioned, and the DevOs team would be able to select a combination of Rancher + KubeSphere or Rancher + Rainbrond, without clashes, to connect the infrastructure downward, to manage the safety and compliance of the cluster is one of Rancher's best, and to increase the experience of using the cloud-origin platform for the final developers, with the ultimate goal of freeing the developers from the previous liftings and to concentrate more on the operations developed.
