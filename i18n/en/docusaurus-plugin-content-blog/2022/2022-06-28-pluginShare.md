article introduces how to share your plugins to the Rainbond open source app store, sharing the extension capabilities of plugins and enriching the plugin market with the Rainbond community.

Because of the greater commonality of the application dimensions and in order to decouple business containers and their viability, Rainbond implemented a plugin mechanism under a component based on SideCar mode.Since the implementation of application operation and maintenance features has great commonality, in order to decouple the business container from its operation and maintenance capabilities, Rainbond implements a plug-in mechanism under components based on the SideCar mode.The Rainbond plug-in can be used as an extension of component operation and maintenance capabilities. The plug-in itself is a sidecar container, which can be used to solve the following problems：

- Extend the functionality of components without changing existing business code
- Complete some data initialization operations before the business runs
- Send business logs to external servers for analysis and processing
- Intercept the traffic of cleaning business and use it as a firewall
- Monitor business performance indicators, etc.

The plugin itself only contains descriptions and implementations, so that it can be reused.A component must be bound to be running when it is not operational.In V5.7.0-release version, Rainbond supports users to share their plugins in the Open Source Store and can be used by other users.

## Plug-in principle

![](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/plugin-share/1.png)

As shown in the figure above, the：plugin has the following features0

- Share the network with the application, and the network space is consistent, so that the plug-in can bypass and truncate the component network traffic, set the component local domain name resolution, etc.
- Shared storage with applications, and file exchange between plugins and components can be done through persistent directories
- Share environment variables with applications, and plugins can share configuration information by reading the environment variables of components

Based on the above features, we can make our own plug-ins and share them with the components in the open source application store for everyone to use.

## Plugin production

Next, we will take the `Fluentd-ElasticSearch6` plug-in as an example to introduce how to make the plug-in.

### Make Fluentd ElasticSearch 6 plugin

1. Go to Rainbond Team View -> Plugins -> New Plugin, create a general type of plugin.
  - Mirror address：qlucky/fluentd-elasticsearch6:v1.14

2. Create a plugin and click Build in the upper right corner to build the plugin.
3. Add a configuration file to the Fluentd plugin, and add a new configuration in `configuration file and shared storage` under the plugin.
  1. Configuration file mount path：/fluentd/etc/fluent.conf

```yaml
<source>
  @type tail
  path /var/log/nginx/access.log
  pos_file /var/log/nginx/nginx.access.log.pos
  <parse>
    @type nginx
  </parse>
  tag es.nginx.log
</source>
<match es.nginx.**>
  @type elasticsearch   
  log_level info          
  hosts 127.0.0.1
  port 9200
  user elastic
  password MagicWord
  index_name fluentd.${tag}
  <buffer>
    chunk_limit_size 2M
    queue_limit_length 32
    flush_interval 5s
    retry_max_times</match>
  </buffer>

```

### Use Fluentd plugin

1. Create a component based on an image, the image uses `nginx:latest`, and the mount storage is`var/log/nginx`.
  - After the storage is mounted in the component, the plugin will also mount the storage by itself, and can collect the logs generated by Nginx.
2. In the Nginx component -> plug-in -> is not activated, open the Fluentd plug-in, and update/restart the component to take effect.
3. Based on open source app store installation `Elasticsearch 6.2.4`
4. Add dependencies, Nginx (plug-in has been activated) depends on Elasticsearch, update/restart Nginx components to make the dependencies take effect.
5. Access the external port of the Nginx component to generate access logs.
6. Enter Kibana -> Management -> Kibana -> Index Patterns, add Index, and enter Discover to view log information.

## Plugin sharing

> 目前插件只能配合组件进行发布，因此在发布插件时，应用下的业务组件也会发布，但从商店安装插件时，应用不会被安装。所以建议在发布时，选择镜像较小的基础组件绑定该插件进行发布。如：Nginx。我们后续也会持续优化此发布流程。减少不必要的镜像推送。

Application View -> Publish -> Create a new application template -> Check to publish as a plug-in -> Select the component with the plug-in enabled to publish, and confirm the publish.

After the release is complete, please refer to [App Store App Listing](https://www.rainbond.com/docs/use-manual/app-store-manage/share-app "应用商店应用上架")After the release, all community members can install this plugin.
