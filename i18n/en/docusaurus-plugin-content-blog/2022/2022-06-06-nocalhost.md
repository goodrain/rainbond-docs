This article will introduce how to use Nocalhost to quickly develop the development process and practical steps of microservice applications on Rainbond.

Nocalhost can directly develop applications in Kubernetes, and Rainbond can quickly deploy microservice projects without writing Yaml. Nocalhost combined with Rainbond accelerates our microservice development efficiency.

## 1. Introduction

**[Nocalhost](https://nocalhost.dev "Nocalhost") is an open source IDE-based cloud native application development toolÔºö**

- Build, test, and debug applications directly in a Kubernetes cluster
- Provides an easy-to-use IDE plugin (supports VS Code and JetBrains), and Nocalhost maintains the same development experience as local development even when developing and debugging in a Kubernetes cluster
- Develop with Instant File SyncÔºö Instantly sync your code changes to remote containers without rebuilding images or restarting containers.

**[Rainbond](https://www.rainbond.com/docs "Rainbond") is a cloud-native application management platformÔºö**

- It is easy to use, does not need to understand containers, Kubernetes and the underlying complex technologies, supports the management of multiple Kubernetes clusters, and manages the entire life cycle of enterprise applications.The main functions include application development environment, application market, microservice architecture, application delivery, application operation and maintenance, application-level multi-cloud management, etc.‰∏ªË¶ÅÂäüËÉΩÂåÖÊã¨Â∫îÁî®ÂºÄÂèëÁéØÂ¢É„ÄÅÂ∫îÁî®Â∏ÇÂú∫„ÄÅÂæÆÊúçÂä°Êû∂ÊûÑ„ÄÅÂ∫îÁî®‰∫§‰ªò„ÄÅÂ∫îÁî®ËøêÁª¥„ÄÅÂ∫îÁî®Á∫ßÂ§ö‰∫ëÁÆ°ÁêÜÁ≠â„ÄÇ

## 2. Local + Rainbond development of microservices

In the past, when we developed microservices locally + Rainbond, we ran the modules to be developed locally, and other modules ran on Rainbond. We communicated and debugged locally through the Rainbond gateway.

This will encounter some problemsÔºö

- Difficulty in multi-person collaborative development and joint debugging
- local environment differentiation
- Cannot call other microservices through the registry (Nacos)
- Remote debugging is difficult
- Limited to local resources

## 3. Use Nocalhost + Rainbond to develop microservices

Now when we develop microservices through Nocalhost + Rainbond, all services run on Rainbond. When developing, the local Vscode is directly connected to the Rainbond component, and is synchronized with the local code to the Rainbond component in real time.When multiple people develop joint debugging, they can conduct joint debugging between services through the built-in Service Mesh of Rainbond.Â§ö‰∫∫ÂºÄÂèëËÅîË∞ÉÊó∂ÔºåÂèØÈÄöËøá Rainbond ÂÜÖÁΩÆÁöÑ Service Mesh ËøõË°åÊúçÂä°‰πãÈó¥ËÅîË∞É„ÄÇ

- Multi-person joint debugging and development are more convenient
- Services all run on Rainbond, no longer limited to local
- closer to production
- Remote Debug
- Call other microservice components through the registry (Nacos)

## 4. Practical steps

Nocalhost currently supports two developmentÔºö

- Repliace DevMode
- Duplicate DevMode

This article will mainly introduce Replace DevMode. When entering Replace DevMode, Nocalhost will perform the following operations on the component:

1. Reduce the number of copies to 1

2. Replace the container's image with a development image

3. Add a sidecar container.

4. Forward a local port to the file sync server.

5. Start the local file sync client.

6. Open a remote terminal.

### 4.1 Install Nocalhost plugin

Nocalhost supports `VScode` `JetBrains`, here we mainly introduce [VScode plugin installation](https://nocalhost.dev/docs/installation "VScode Êèí‰ª∂ÂÆâË£Ö")refer to the official website documentation.

1. Open VScode, click the `Extension` button ![img](https://nocalhost.dev/zh-CN/img/icons/vs-code-icon.jpg) icon on the left
2. Enter `Nocalhost` in the search box, select `Nocalhost plugin`, and click the **Install** button

### 4.2 Install Rainbond

We choose [to install Rainbond](https://www.rainbond.com/docs/installation/install-with-ui/host-install-with-ui "Âü∫‰∫é‰∏ªÊú∫ÂÆâË£Ö Rainbond")based on the host

### 4.3 Nocalhost docking with Rainbond cluster

1. Get `kubeconfig` file, enter the Rainbond cluster view -> click on node configuration -> kubeconfig

![](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/nocalhost/4.png)

2. We copy `kubeconfig` files to local and save as `yaml` files.

3. Open Vscode, click button <img src="https://nocalhost.dev/zh-CN/img/icons/logo-light.svg" width="3%" />, open the Nocalhost plugin, select Connect to Cluster, select the path of our `kubeconfig` file, and click Add Cluster to add a cluster.

4. After the addition is complete, as shown in FigureÔºö

### 4.4 Deploying Spring Cloud Microservices on Rainbond

1. Here, choose to install the Spring Cloud Pig microservice component from the open source application store, and search for Pig in the application store to install it.

2. After the deployment is complete, the effect is as followsÔºö

### 4.5 Enter Nocalhost development mode

Above, we have connected the cluster in the local Vscode, and have also installed the Spring Cloud Pig microservice in Rainbond, then we will select one of the components in the local Vscode for development. Here, in order to make the effect more obvious, choose to develop `pig-ui` component.

[Spring Cloud Pig backend](https://gitee.com/zhangbigqi/pig "Spring Cloud Pig backend")

[Spring Cloud Pig front end](https://gitee.com/zhangbigqi/pig-ui "Spring Cloud Pig front end")

#### 4.5.1 Clone Pig-ui code to local

```shell
git clone https://gitee.com/zhangbigqi/pig-ui
```

#### 4.5.2 Start local development

Open Vscode, click button <img src="https://nocalhost.dev/zh-CN/img/icons/logo-light.svg" width="3%" />, and find our Pig-ui component. Since the application is installed from the open source application store, the Deployment name is an automatically generated string, and we need to query it in the component.

<img src="https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/nocalhost/10.png" width="30%" />

We click üî® next to it to enter the development mode,

1. Prompt to select a container, we choose the container `gred5f1c` , the remaining container is Rainbond's Mesh container, which is used for internal communication and cannot be replaced.
2. Prompt to specify the source code directory, select the code directory we just cloned.
3. After waiting for a while, the terminal interface of the remote container will be opened by default and the files in the container will be synchronized with the local in real time, as followsÔºö

#### 4.5.3 Start the project

1. Install project dependencies, execute

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

2. run the project

   ```shell
   npm run dev
   ```

After startup, the effect is as follows, the port in the container is 80

![](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/nocalhost/13.png)

3. Turn on port forwarding, click button <img src="https://nocalhost.dev/zh-CN/img/icons/logo-light.svg" width="3%" />, find our Deployment, right-click to select Port Forward, Add Port Forward, enter `38000:80` to forward the container's port 80 to the local port 38000.

<img src="https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/nocalhost/14.png" width="30%" />

4. The page can be accessed through `http://localhost:38000` , and you can also log in normally.

![](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/nocalhost/15.png)

#### 4.5.4 Modify the code to check the effect

The above has demonstrated that if the service in the remote container is accessed locally, let's modify the code to see the effect.

‰øÆÊîπ `src/page/wel.vue`ÔºåÊñ∞Â¢û‰∏ÄÊÆµ‰ª£Á†ÅÔºå‰øùÂ≠ò„ÄÇModify `src/page/wel.vue`, add a piece of code, save it.It can be found that when we save, the terminal is automatically restarted, which is consistent with the local development effect.

Modifications to files are synced to the container in real time.

![](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/nocalhost/16.png)

Refresh page`http://localhost:38000`, you can see that the modified content has taken effect.

## write at the end

Through the above practical steps, we have been able to develop microservice applications on Rainbond through Nocalhost, get rid of local development, and enter cloud-native rapid development to improve our development efficiency.

This article only introduces the basic development, you can also configure [Nocalhost development configuration](https://nocalhost.dev/docs/config/config-overview-en "NocalhostÂºÄÂèëÈÖçÁΩÆ") for the project, etc. Friends can explore by themselves.
