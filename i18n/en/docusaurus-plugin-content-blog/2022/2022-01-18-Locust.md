[Locust](https://locust.io) is an easy-to-use, writable and extensible performance test tool.And there is a user-friendly, web interface that shows test progress in real time.You can even change load when testing is running.It can also run without a UI to make it easy to use for CI/CD tests.

Locust makes it easy to run load tests that are distributed across multiple machines.Locust is based on events (gevent), so it can support thousands of concurrent users on a single computer.In contrast to many other event-based applications, it does not use callbacks.Instead, it uses lightweight processes via gevent.Each Locust (locust) concurrently accessing the site is actually running in its own process (Greenlet).This allows users to write very expressive scenarios in Python without having to use callbacks or other mechanisms. :::Locust is based on events and can therefore support thousands of parallel users on a computer.Compared to many other event-based applications, it does not use callbacks.Instead, it uses a lightweight process through gevent.Every Locust (locusts) that has concurrent access to the site actually runs in its own process (Greenlet).This allows users to write a very performing scenario in Python, without using a callback or other mechanism.

## Rapid deployment of Locust

`Locust` application has been released to `open source app store`, search `locust` and install the latest`2.5.1`version.

After the installation is complete, you will get a Locust master-slave cluster, in which the master component is responsible for providing the UI interface and scheduling concurrent tasks; the slave component is responsible for executing concurrent tasks, and the slave component also supports horizontal scaling. When the generated test concurrency reaches a certain level When the limit is reached, you only need to expand the instance of the slave component, such as：

## how to use

`Locust_Master` provides a graphical management interface based on WEB-UI. When you log in for the first time, you will be prompted to enter some information：

> The default user password is：locust locust, which can be modified by configuring the environment variable `LOCUST_WEB_AUTH`of the `Locust_Master` component.

**Number of users** Fill in the number of simulated concurrent users. After testing, a single slave instance can easily provide the pressure of thousands of concurrent users.

**Spawn rate** Fill in the hatch rate of`Locusts`, that is, how many users are generated per second.

**Host** Fill in the site address you want to stress test.

After the Host and the user, the concurrency is defined, it is necessary to define the test case, that is, the behavior of the user after accessing the Host. Locust defines the user behavior through a Python script named`/locustfile.py` On the Rainbond platform `Locust_Master` components within `environment configuration` -> `configuration file settings` for editing modification.

![](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/locust/locustfile.png)

The code example is as：

```python
from locust import HttpUser, task, between

class MyUser(HttpUser):
    wait_time = between(5, 15)

    @task(2)
    def index(self):
        self.client.get("/")

    @ task(1)
    def about(self):
        self.client.get("/docs/")
```

This script will mimic the following behavior in order：

1. Host's \`path twice
2. Request Host's `/docs/` path once
3. Between each execution of the task, the interval is 5-15 seconds

The reason for this design is that the designers of Locust believe that the real user behavior will not execute all the requests one after another like a script and then exit.In more cases, after the user has done one thing, he will pause for a while, such as reading the instructions and thinking about what to do next.So a blank period of random duration is left between each step.This assumption is actually more in line with the actual user behavior.更多的情况是，用户做完一件事后，会停顿一会，比如读读说明，思考下一步要干嘛。所以会在每个步骤之间留下一个随机时长的空白期。这种假设实际上更符合用户实际行为。

This file will be mounted on the `locust_master` component as a configuration file, and shared with all`locust_slave`components.This means that if you want to change the content of this file, you only need to edit the configuration file mounted under the environment configuration in the `locust_master` component.Then update the entire Locust cluster to take effect.这意味着，如果你想要更改这个文件的内容，只需要去编辑 `locust_master` 组件中，环境配置下所挂载的配置文件即可。然后更新整个 Locust 集群即可生效。

## Result analysis

With the help of the WEB-UI interface provided by Locust, we can easily analyze the stress test results.

![](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/locust/locust-result.png)

The Statistics page will show us a summary report of all the interfaces under pressure.Results include：结果包括：

**Type** Request Type;\
**Name** Request Path;\
**Requests** Total Requests;\
**Fails** Fails;\
**Median** Median Response Time;\
**90%ile** 90% Request response time;\
**Average** Average response time;\
**Min** Minimum response time;\
**Max** Maximum response time;\
**Average size** Average size of requests;\
**Current PRS** Current throughput rate;\
**Current Failures** Current error rate;

![](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/locust/locust-charts.png)

The Charts page plots key results as time-varying charts that guide users on trends.

In addition to these, there are several notable values that will be displayed globally in the top row, including the host domain name of the current request, the number of concurrent users currently generated, the number of slave nodes, the total throughput rate of all currently requested interfaces, errors Rate.and a button to stop the test.以及停止测试的按钮。

Several other pages will provide：

**Failures** Request failed interface and failure reason;\
**Expections** Unexpected error in test and error reason\
**Download Data** Download address of test data in csv format\
**Workers** Information of all slave instances
