OpenVSCode is an online IDE code editor based on the web interface. It can be used, lighter, more efficient, simple. Its basic functionality is completely inherited from Microsoft's [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It can continue to be enhanced by installing extensions.The OpenVSCode launched by Rainbond Open Source Store pre-installs the gitlab-workflow extension to access the privatization repository Gitlab, and preload the common language operating environment (current version has been integrated in Golang, Node.js, python, jav) to quickly debug business code in the Terminal Terminal.

Rainbond has the capacity to quickly build an integrated development environment that will complete the business from the code to the final online full process by connecting to the repository webhook mechanism.Rainbond has the ability to quickly build an integrated development environment, and complete the whole process from the start of the code to the final launch of the business through the docking of the code warehouse webhook mechanism.By incorporating the OpenVSCode cloud IDE, the Rainbond integrated development system can be hosted on the cloud, and developers only need a browser to complete the entire process from editing to online. :::

In order to achieve the above goals, this article will explain：in the order of operations.

- One-click installation of OpenVSCode and Gitlab

> With Rainbond's built-in open source application store, one-click installation of OpenVSCode and Gitlab is the fastest way to build an integrated development system.

- OpenVSCode docking with Gitlab

> With the extension mechanism that comes with OpenVSCode, the docking with Gitlab is completed, and the code repository in Gitlab can be obtained.

- Coding and debugging

> With the help of OpenVSCode, complete various advanced operations related to coding and debugging based on the browser.

- Gitlab docking with Rainbond

> Open up Rainbond and Gitlab through the Oauth2.0 protocol, easily deploy the project in Gitlab to Rainbond, and automatically configure the Webhook.

- Code commit triggers automatic build

> Verify the effect of the entire scene, submit the code from OpenVSCode, and complete the automatic release of the deployment project on Rainbond.

## One-click installation of OpenVScode and Gitlab

Both OpenVSCode and Gitlab referenced in the integrated development system have been added to the Rainbond open source application store for users to install and deploy with one click.

Search in the open source application store, click Install to deploy the Gitlab application with one click, pay attention to select `14.8.2` version：

### OpenVSCode docking with Gitlab

The OpenVSCode provided by Rainbond integrates the Gitlab-workflow extension by default, which provides OpenVSCode with the ability to connect to the Gitlab code repository. Developers can directly view the code repository hosted in Gitlab and clone it into the workspace with one click.

- OpenVSCode docking with Gitlab repository

  - By docking with the code repository, you can pull and submit code more quickly, and you can debug the code through the IDE

  - Fill in the URL corresponding to Gitlab (if it is Gitlab deployed on the platform, it is the domain name accessed by http) and token.

  - After the connection is successful, you can directly clone the warehouse code to perform coding, debugging, and push functions on the terminal.

- Gitlab Get Token

  - 在GitLab中，单击右上角并选择“首选项”在左侧边栏中。选择访问令牌，然后选择“添加个人访问令牌”
  - permission：api , read_user

### Coding and debugging

After completing the connection between OpenVSCode and Gitlab, you can directly read the project in Gitlab for cloning operation.

Depending on the development language, extensions for various development languages can be installed online to improve the convenience of editing code.

The experience of editing code is the same as that of a local IDE.

After opening Terminal, you can operate on the command line interface. OpenVSCode integrates the maven build tool by default, which is convenient for building Jar packages for testing.

The next step after the build is complete is to start the project directly in Terminal.

After the debugged project is started, it listens to port 5000. The developer only needs to open the external service of port 5000 for OpenVSCode to access the service being debugged.

### Gitlab docking with Rainbond

完成编码与调试后，开发人员的业务进入了部署阶段。After coding and debugging, the developer's business enters the deployment phase.To make the whole process more automated, developers can connect Gitlab and Rainbond.

The Oauth2 protocol can be used between Gitlab and Rainbond to open up the single sign-on process, which is convenient for users to directly select the repository in gitlab to deploy the code in the Rainbond interface, and automatically configure the webhook to complete the automatic construction after the code commit.

For configuration and usage, see previous articles：

[GitLab and Rainbond integrate to realize an integrated development environment](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/JtV2gvPLC22jbPTeLQJqyA)

After completing the connection between Gitlab and Rainbond, you can select the project in Gitlab to deploy in the Rainbond interface.

Turning on the automatic build switch can automatically configure Gitlab's Webhook. Once Gitlab receives the specified push information, it will trigger Rainbond to automatically build the current service component.

### Code commit triggers automatic build

Add the keyword @deploy to the Commit information when the project file is modified and submitted. After the submission is successful, rainbond will automatically trigger an automatic build.
