:::info In the [Rainbond](https://www.rainbond.com/) cluster, each team corresponds to a Namespace of the underlying Kubernetes. Because the underlying network used before cannot perform network management at the Namespace level, so between different teams under the same Rainbond cluster, so the components Mutual access can be freely performed, and users cannot make any restrictions on this, which also leads to the existence of hidden security risks in the underlying network.Now the Kubernetes cluster provided by cilium for network services can solve this problem very well. Users can formulate network policies for each team and each component according to their own needs, strengthen the underlying network management, and realize the security control of the network layer. . :::The Kubernetes cluster, which is now serviced by the cell, can solve this problem well, and users can develop a network strategy for each team and each component according to their own needs and strengthen bottom network management to secure the network layer.

## Using cilium as a Kubernetes network service

- When using the installation from the host, modify the network.plugin value to none

  ![](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/cilium/1.png)

- install helm

```bash
wget https://goodrain-pkg.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/pkg/helm && chmod +x helm && mv helm /usr/local/bin/
```

- deploy cilium

```bash
helm repo add cilium https://helm.cilium.io/
helm install cilium cilium/cilium --version 1.11.2 --namespace kube-system --set operator.replicas=1

kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o custom-columns=NAMESPACE:.metadata.namespace,NAME:.metadata.name,HOSTNETWORK:.spec.hostNetwork --no-headers=true | grep '<none>' | awk '{print "-n "$1" " $2}' | xargs -L 1 -r kubectl delete pod

```

- verify cilium

Download cilium command line tool

```bash
curl -L --remote-name-all https://github.com/cilium/cilium-cli/releases/latest/download/cilium-linux-amd64.tar.gz{,.sha256sum}
sha256sum --check cilium -linux-amd64.tar.gz.sha256sum
sudo tar xzvfC cilium-linux-amd64.tar.gz /usr/local/bin
rm cilium-linux-amd64.tar.gz{,.sha256sum}
```

- confirm status

```bash
$ cilium status --wait

- Test network connectivity (when testing domestic servers, tests involving external networks may fail, which does not affect normal use)

```bash
$ cilium connectivity test

## Set up team network isolation

Cilium's network isolation policy follows the whitelist mechanism. Without creating a network policy, it does not impose any restrictions on the network. After a network policy is created for a set of pods of a specified type, all requests except the access addresses allowed in the policy will be blocked. reject.

- Preliminary preparation

  - Create two development teams and test teams with English names set to dev and test
  - Create nginx-dev and nginx-test components under the development team and test team, open the internal port, and set the internal domain name to nginx-dev and nginx-test respectively
  - Create client components under development and test teams

- no restrictions

  All services between teams can communicate freely without any special restrictions

- Restrictions only allow components within this team to access each other, and isolate other teams from accessing

  In actual production, multiple teams such as development, testing, and production may be deployed in a cluster at the same time. Based on security considerations, it is necessary to isolate each team from the network and prohibit other teams from accessing it. The development team is used as an example to illustrate how to restrict access to it from other teams.

- Cilium network policy file (dev-ingress.yaml)

```yaml
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: "dev-namespace-ingress"
spec:
endpointSelector:
matchLabels:
"k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace": dev
ingress:
- fromEndpoints:
- matchLabels:
"k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace": dev
```

- Create a policy

```bash
kubectl create -f dev-ingress.yaml -n dev
```

- Confirmation Policy

```bash
$ kubectl get CiliumNetworkPolicy -A
NAMESPACE NAME AGE
dev dev-namespace-ingress 39s
```

- Test effect

- Set the nginx-dev component under the development team to only allow components under the test team to access

  In some cases, the security requirements of some components will be more stringent, and only some components within the team that meet the requirements may be allowed to access. The following uses nginx-dev as an example to illustrate how to restrict access to only some components.

- Cilium network policy file (nginx-dev-ingress0.yaml)

```bash
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: "nginx-dev-ingress"
spec:
endpointSelector:
matchLabels:
name: grc156cb
ingress:
- fromEndpoints:
- matchLabels:
name: 
```

- Create a policy

```bash
kubectl create -f nginx-dev-ingress0.yaml -n dev
```

- Confirmation Policy

```bash
$ kubectl get CiliumNetworkPolicy -A
NAMESPACE NAME AGE
dev nginx-dev-ingress0 85s
```

- Test effect

- While setting the development team to allow the components under this team to access, allow the nginx-dev component under the development team to be accessed by any component in the test team

  When the team network isolation is set, sometimes it is necessary to temporarily open some components for other teams to access for debugging. The following uses the nginx-dev component as an example to illustrate how to open the access rights of external teams when network isolation is set.

- Cilium network policy file (nginx-dev-ingress1.yaml)

```yaml
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: "nginx-dev-ingress1"
spec:
endpointSelector:
matchLabels:
name: grc156cb
ingress:
- fromEndpoints:
- matchLabels:
"k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace": test
```

- Create a policy

```bash
kubectl create -f dev-ingress.yaml -n dev
kubectl create -f nginx-dev-ingress.yaml -n dev
```

- Confirmation Policy

```bash
$ kubectl get CiliumNetworkPolicy -A
NAMESPACE NAME AGE
dev dev-namespace-ingress 19s
dev nginx-dev-ingress1 12s
```

- Test effect
