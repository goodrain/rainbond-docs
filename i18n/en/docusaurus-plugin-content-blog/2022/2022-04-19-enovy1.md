# Introduction to Envoy's circuit breaker mechanism

熔断是分布式系统的重要组成部分。快速失败并尽快给下游施加压力，可以防止整个微服务系统进入糟糕的级联雪崩状态。这是Envoy 网格的主要优点之一，Envoy 在网络级别实现强制断路限制，而不必独立配置和编写每个应用程序。Envoy 支持各种类型的完全分布（不协调）的熔断：

- **Cluster Maximum Connections (MaxConnections)**：The maximum number of connections that Envoy will establish for all hosts in the upstream cluster.In practice, this only works with HTTP/1.1 clusters, since HTTP/2 uses a single connection to each host.实际上，这仅适用于HTTP/1.1群集，因为HTTP/2使用到每个主机的单个连接。

- **Cluster maximum pending requests (MaxPendingRequests)**：The maximum number of requests that will be queued while waiting for a ready connection pool connection.In practice, this only works with HTTP/1.1 clusters, as HTTP/2 connection pools do not queue requests.HTTP/2 requests are reused immediately.If this circuit breaker overflows, the cluster's`upstream_rq_pending_overflow`counter will be incremented.实际上，这仅适用于HTTP/1.1群集，因为HTTP/2连接池不会排队请求。HTTP/2请求立即复用。如果这个断路器溢出，集群的`upstream_rq_pending_overflow`计数器将增加。

- **集群最大请求数(MaxRequests)**：在任何给定时间，群集中所有主机可以处理的最大请求数。实际上，这适用于HTTP/2群集，因为HTTP/1.1群集由最大连接断路器控制。如果这个断路器溢出，集群的`upstream_rq_pending_overflow`计数器将增加。

- **集群最大活动重试次数(MaxRetries)**：在任何给定时间，集群中所有主机可以执行的最大重试次数。一般来说，我们建议积极进行断路重试，以便允许零星故障重试，但整体重试量不能爆炸并导致大规模级联故障。如果这个断路器溢出，集群的`upstream_rq_retry_overflow`计数器将递增。

每个熔断阈值可以按照每个上游集群和每个优先级进行配置和跟踪。这允许分布式系统的不同组件被独立地调整并且具有不同的熔断配置。

## Fusing based on plug-in mechanism

The Rainbond cloud-native application management platform uses its own plug-in mechanism to realize the fuse of specified microservices for downstream components.

The default installed Rainbond has integrated `export network management plug-in` and `integrated network management plug-in`  , both of which are implemented based on `Envoy` , which can perform more comprehensive network management on the network export direction of the microservices installed with the plug-in.This includes the implementation of the circuit breaker mechanism.其中就包括对熔断机制的实现。

To better describe this process, an example is specially prepared.

The pressure generator based on [Locust](https://locust.io) is used as the client, the `integrated network management plug-in`is installed, and the Java-maven component is used as the server.The stress generator can set the number of concurrent users according to the graphical interface, and perform stress testing on the service address of Java-maven. During this period, we can collect various phenomena when the circuit breaker mechanism is triggered.压力生成器可以根据图形化界面设置并发用户数量，对 Java-maven 的服务地址进行压力测试，在此期间，我们可以收集到触发熔断机制时的各种现象。

![circuit-breaker-9](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/envoy-circuitbreak/circuit-breaker-9.png)

`The installation of the integrated network management plug-in` is very simple. Click to install the specified plug-in on the plug-in page of the service component of the client (the pressure generator in the example) that initiates the request.

## Set the blowout threshold

The Java-maven component is implemented based on the Http/1.1 version protocol. According to the explanation of the Envoy circuit breaker mechanism in the first section, we can set it by limiting the maximum number of connections in **clusters (MaxConnections)** and **clusters (MaxPendingRequests)** fuse condition.

Click the plug-in of the pressure generator component to view the configuration of the `-exit network management plug-in` , and you can enter its configuration page.

`The integrated network management plug-in` is divided into two configuration areas: inbound network management configuration and outbound network management configuration. The setting of the fusing threshold is located in the outbound network management configuration area.

To highlight the effect of the experiment, I set both `MaxConnections` and `MaxPendingRequests` to small values.

![circuit-breaker-2](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/envoy-circuitbreak/circuit-breaker-2.png)

The configuration in the figure means that the maximum number of connections to the cluster is 6, and the maximum number of requests waiting is 1 (the default value for both is 1024).This configuration is equivalent to generating the following configuration：for Envoy这一配置，相当于为 Envoy 生成了以下配置：

```json
"circuit_breakers": {
  "default": {
    "max_connections": 6,
    "max_pending_requests": 1
  }
}
```

The `Domains` set for the 5000 port of the downstream application Java-maven is also very important, the pressure generator can apply pressure to the 5000 port of Java-maven by accessing the domain name `java-maven`.

## trigger fuse

Web pages based on Locust can set concurrency conditions. In this experiment, I set up 97 concurrent requests for domain name `http://java-maven`. The Locust page will show the total number of requests made, as well as the number of requests in a failed state. Locust 的页面中会体现出发起请求的总数，以及处于失败状态的请求数。

![circuit-breaker-4](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/envoy-circuitbreak/circuit-breaker-4.png)

All bad requests get a 503 status code returned by the circuit breaker mechanism.

![circuit-breaker-5](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/envoy-circuitbreak/circuit-breaker-5.png)

In order to confirm that the number of Tcp connections between the pressure generator and the Java-maven component is indeed limited, you can enter the Java

-maven's web terminal is viewed with the command.

![circuit-breaker-3](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/envoy-circuitbreak/circuit-breaker-3.png)

The `172.20.1.74` in the command is the Pod IP address of the pressure generator component.

It should be noted here that do not query the number of Tcp connections in the pressure generator. This number will be more than 6, but it should actually be 97, because the Locust process that initiates the request will generate Tcp connections according to the number of concurrent users. This process does not Restricted by the circuit breaker mechanism, when the request passes through Envoy, only 6 connections will be successfully established and maintained to the Java-maven server.

## Raise the fuse threshold

Next, by adjusting the configuration of `integrated network management plugin` , adjust the threshold of fuse, and increase `MaxConnections` to 66.

![circuit-breaker-6](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/envoy-circuitbreak/circuit-breaker-6.png)

After clicking Update Configuration, the changes will take effect directly without restarting the component.

Appropriately increase the number of concurrent users to 250 in the stress generator, and restart the stress test. It can be found that incorrect requests are no longer generated.

![circuit-breaker-7](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/envoy-circuitbreak/circuit-breaker-7.png)

Re-query the number of tcp connections established in the Java-maven environment, and found that it is no longer 6, but has increased, but has not reached the threshold of 66.

持续提升并发用户数量，则可以再次触发熔断。

## Summarize

熔断是微服务网络治理体系中非常重要的一环。Circuit breaker is a very important part of the microservice network governance system.In the ServiceMesh microservice framework implemented by Rainbond combined with Envoy, the fuse mechanism implemented by plug-ins is easy to use and supports dynamic entry, which is very friendly to operators.

In the next article, we will introduce the implementation of full streaming, so stay tuned.
