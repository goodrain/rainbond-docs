Envoy can be used as a proxy implementation in the Service Mesh microservice framework. The built-in microservice framework of Rainbond is also implemented based on Envoy.The circuit breaker practice described in this article is implemented based on Rainbond's unique plug-in mechanism.The smelting practices described here are based on the implementation of Rainbond unique plugins mechanisms.

## Envoy speed limit

尽管分布式熔断器在大多数情况下控制分布式系统中的吞吐量非常有效，但有时它的效果并不是很好，这时候便需要全局限速。最常见的情况是当大量主机转发到少量主机并且平均请求延迟很短时（例如，发送给数据库服务器的连接/请求）。若目标主机成为备机，则下游主机将压垮上游集群。在这种情况下，很难对每个下游主机配置足够严格的熔断器，使得系统可以平稳运行，同时，当系统开始出现故障时，仍然可以防止级联故障。对于这种情况，全局限速是一个很好的解决方案。

The Envoy global rate limit solution needs to be implemented based on a global RLS (rate limit service) service. RLS is designed as a Go/gRPC service that provides different rate limit scenarios for different types of applications.

## Build a global speed limit service

An out-of-the-box full rate limiting service has been incorporated into Rainbond's built-in open source app store, and users can install rate limiting services with one click based on the following operations.

- **Access to the built-in open source app store**

> Select the **app market** tab on the left, switch to the **open source app store** tab on the page, and search for the keyword **rate limit**\*\* to find the rate limiting service.

![ratelimit-2](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/envoy-ratelimit/envoy-ratelimit-2.png)

- **A key installation**

> Click **to install** on the right side of the rate limiting service to enter the installation page. After filling in the simple information, click **to confirm** to start the installation, and the page automatically jumps to the topology view.

After a few minutes, the rate limiting service will be installed and running.

## Full speed limit configuration

The global rate limit can be configured by editing the configuration file `/data/ratelimit/config/config.yaml`in the `Rate-limit-service` component.

The default configuration content is as follows：

```yaml
domain: limit.common
descriptors:
  - key: remote_address
    rate_limit:
      unit: second
      requests_per_unit: 10

  # Black list IP
  - key: remote_address
    value: 50.0.0.5
    rate_limit:
      unit: second
      requests_per_unit: 0
```

In this section of configuration, a rate limit configuration that allows 10 requests per second to pass through for domain name `domain` is defined.

For the case where the client IP is `50.0.0.5` , the speed limit configuration that allows 0 requests per second to pass through is implemented, which can be understood as a blacklist configuration by users.

More configuration examples can be found on GitHub - [/ratelimit: Go/gRPC service designed to enable generic rate limit scenarios from different types of applications.](https://github.com/envoyproxy/ratelimit#examples)

## Citing a global speed limit service

The service components that need to be speed-limited need to meet the following conditions：

- Install and configure **service integrated network management plugin**

- Dependency `Rate-limit-service`

Rainbond expands the operation and maintenance capabilities of the business through the plug-in mechanism. By installing the **-service integrated network management plug-in** , the management capabilities can be expanded at the network entrance of the speed-limited business.**Service integrated network management plug-in** essentially expands the capabilities of Envoy, and realizes the full speed limit function by calling `Rate-limit-service`.**服务综合网络治理插件** 本质上扩展了 Envoy 能力，通过调用 `Rate-limit-service` ，实现全局限速功能。

![ratelimit-5](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/envoy-ratelimit/envoy-ratelimit-5.png)

Make sure that `OPEN_LIMIT (whether to enable current limiting)` option is `YES`, `LIMIT_DOMAIN (domain name corresponding to the current limiting rule)` is consistent with `domian` in the full current limiting configuration above.So far, the configuration on the side of the speed-limited service is completed.至此，完成了被限速服务一侧的配置。

## verify

In order to verify whether the speed limit takes effect, the [Locust stress test tool](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/greebbqDh-a5JJJkfokh4Q)is introduced to continuously generate access requests to the speed-limited services.

![ratelimit-10](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/envoy-ratelimit/envoy-ratelimit-10.png)

After the default global speed limit policy is applied, about 74% of the total number of accesses is limited by the speed-limited business at 40 RPS.

![ratelimit-7](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/envoy-ratelimit/envoy-ratelimit-7.png)

Access denied, get a 429 return code, and prompt `Too Many Requests`, which is the standard return mode for service rate limiting.

![ratelimit-8](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/envoy-ratelimit/envoy-ratelimit-8.png)

被限速业务所安装的 **服务综合网络治理插件** 支持动态配置。The **-service integrated network management plug-in** installed by the speed-limited service supports dynamic configuration.This means that without stopping the service, you only need to set the `OPEN_LIMIT (whether to turn on the current limit)` option to `NO` and update the configuration, the service speed limit can be turned off, and the number of access errors will drop to 0.

![ratelimit-9](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/envoy-ratelimit/envoy-ratelimit-9.png)

The full speed limit takes effect on the network entry of the speed-limited business, which means that no matter the request comes from other microservice components deployed by Rainbond or from external access outside the gateway, the request will be speed-limited.

## Summarize

The full speed limit is an effective way to protect microservices in sudden traffic surge scenarios. The built-in microservice framework of Rainbond supports the Envoy service speed limit scheme that complies with the RLS specification.The configuration is very simple and supports dynamic changes. The examples in this article strive to show you the configuration practice of the full speed limit in the Rainbond system in an intuitive way.配置起来很简单，并且支持动态变更，本文中的示例力争以直观的方式为大家展现了全局限速在 Rainbond 体系中的配置实践。
