## 1. Background information

### 1.1 The combination of Rainbond and EMQX

[Rainbond](https://www.rainbond.com/?channel=emqx) is an easy-to-use open source cloud-native application management platform.With it, users can complete the deployment and operation and maintenance of microservices in a graphical interface.With the help of the capabilities of Kubernetes and containerization technology, automatic operation and maintenance capabilities such as fault self-healing and elastic scaling can be empowered to users' businesses.借助于它，用户可以在图形化界面中完成微服务的部署与运维。借助 Kubernetes 和容器化技术的能力，将故障自愈、弹性伸缩等自动化运维能力赋能给用户的业务。

Such users no longer need to care about how to deploy EMQX clusters. One-click installation of EMQX high-availability clusters through the open source application store greatly reduces the deployment burden of users using EMQX clusters. Currently, the latest version `4.4.3`is supported.

### 1.2 About application templates

The application template is an installation package for the Rainbond cloud-native application management platform. Based on it, users can install business systems into their own Rainbond with one click.No matter how complex the business system is, the application template will abstract it into an application, and install it together with the images, configuration information of all components in the application, and the relationship between all components.无论这个业务系统多么复杂，应用模版都会将其抽象成为一个应用，裹挟着应用内所有组件的镜像、配置信息以及所有组件之间的关联关系一并安装起来。

## 2. Preconditions

- The deployed Rainbond cloud-native application management platform：such as [Quick Experience Version](https://www.rainbond.com/docs/quick-start/quick-install/?channel=emqx)can run in a personal PC environment at the cost of starting a container.
