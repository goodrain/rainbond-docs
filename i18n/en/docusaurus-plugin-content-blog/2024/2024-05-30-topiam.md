The TOPIAM Enterprise Digital Identification Control Platform is an open-source IDaas/IAM platform, used to manage accounts, permissions, authentication, application access, and helps to integrate all identities of internal office systems, business systems and strategic SaaS systems deployed locally or in the cloud to achieve one account for all applications.

Traditional enterprise IT construction using chimneys can easily lead to the following challenge：

- The application of the authorization to manage chaos is prone to security problems and results in data leaks.
- Identification security is questioned, and the sensitive system lacks a rigorous identification mechanism.
- These management operations are inefficient, duplicative and low-value and decentralized in the systems that independently build an account number system, a system of competencies, an account allocation of authority and an uncontrollable account.Staff members need to write multiple passwords to their accounts.

The TOPIAM Digital Identity Control Platform provides a centralized set of accounts, competencies, certification, audit tools to help untie identity data, achieve the effect of “one account, one certification, multiple passage” and strengthen the enterprise security system while enhancing organizational management efficiency and facilitating digital upgrading of enterprises.

## Use Rainbond to deploy TOPIAM

Rainbond is a cloud based application management platform with a core of 100 per cent open source and Serverlessness, which does not require knowledge of K8 and can easily manage containerized applications, seamlessly transiting to K8, and is the first integrated application management platform in the country that supports national production and is suitable for private deployment.

First [Install Rainbond](https://www.rainbond.com/docs/quick-start/quick-install) or use the following command to install Rainbond

```bash
curl -o install.sh https://get.rainbond.com && cash ./install.sh
```

After signing in Rainbond you choose to install the app from the `Marketplace` to search for `topiam` in the search box, click on the Installation button.

After clicking on installation, wait for all components of the TOPIAM to start automatically, deploy the following：

- Admin (eiam-console)
- Portal (eiam-portal)
- OpenAPI (eiam-openapi)

Click the access button to access the external service address of the `manager` component, default account password `admin/topiam.cn`.User-side login needs to create an account again in the manager, see[TOPIAM文档](https://topiam.cn/docs/introduction/).

## What can TOPIAM do?

The provision of integrated organizational information management and multi-dimensional equivalence to achieve efficient and integrated management of business personnel, organizational structures and applied information on a single platform.

• Support the integration of identity sources, such as nails, flyers, and implementation of systems and enterprise OA platform data interfaces using users as a management basis for changes in the permissions of their respective applications in connection with personnel events, such as entry, separation, reassignment, part-time assignment, changes in their respective applications, and secure security controls for access to applications.

Support social certification integration such as micromessages, microblogs, QQ and others to enable firms to quickly integrate into Internet-based authentication.

![](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/topiam/3.png)

Supporting authentication protocols and mechanisms such as OIDC, OAuth2, SAML2, CAS, JWT, Form Filling etc. to achieve single point login.

![](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/topiam/4.png)

Complete security audits that document each user's behaviour in a detailed manner, allow each step of operation to be documented, record the information security status of the enterprise in real time and accurately identify the sources of unusual business access and potential threats.

Violence-breaker mechanisms, after a certain number of failed attempts, automatically lock accounts and effectively prevent malicious users from attempting to login multiple times using violent resolution techniques, rendering further attempts to login ineffective.

A full password policy mechanism that sets the corresponding password complexity, the corresponding unlock policy and allows for advanced policies such as allowing repeat with history password.At the same time, the security intensity of the password can be checked by enabling the weak password dictionary library.

Provide standard openapi interface that easily completes institutional user synchronization and fine-tune enterprise management of account life cycles.

## Last

TOPIAM has a lot of scenarios to combine the applications deployed on Rainbond and Rainbond and will continue to export the series of articles such as：TOPIAM on Rainbond user login system, SpringBoot OIDC, please wait!
