The platform project, which may have been heard, is a new term that adds new elements to the already crowded constellation of roles in the fields of development and DevOs.

In this article, we will describe the platform project, its differences from DevOs, and why you may consider using platform projects and who needs the ability to do them.

## What is Platform Project?

Platform engineering is the design, construction and maintenance of workflows and tools for software development teams and the harmonization of team work and faster processing of daily permanent duties.

Many platform engineers will also maintain a software called the **Internal Developer Platform** that brings together information and knowledge from different clouds, tools, and teams so that all engineers can find in one place the information they need about their applications, services, and infrastructure.

This area arises from the growing complexity of software development, the increasing number of tools and processes involved and the growing number of things that developers need to address.

## Why is the platform project?

The platform works were designed to help software developers cope with the complexity of developing applications.While the goal of DevOps is to deploy and run automated applications, in practice only some large or more capable teams can do so.

In reality, some problems arise when some teams get rid of the maintainers and implement DevOps.A study shows, for example, that the top organizations are able to successfully implement the **Who develops and who delivers it** model, but other teams have failed to try this model.

Senior developers often have to play the role of behind-the-scenes convoys, leaving the most valuable development resources – the most expensive resources that should have been used to improve the speed and quality of development teams – unable to focus on their own development efforts, because they have to spend time on operational tasks.

This results in the fragmentation and uneven quality of the work in the organization depending on the amount of time that senior developers can devote to building and maintenance.

The difference between successful and unsuccessful organizations is that successful organizations have a dedicated team to maintain an internal developer platform to support development teams.These dedicated teams allow development teams to focus on creating software features rather than managing dependence, water flow lines and tools.

## Platform Project Challenge

While platform engineering has brought many benefits to the development team, there are some challenges to its implementation.

- **Complexity of cross-team collaboration**：platform works that cross multiple team boundaries and involve multiple functional sectors such as development, transport, security, quality assurance, etc.How to reconcile the needs of these teams and ensure that changes in the platform meet the expectations of all teams is a daunting task.The absence of effective communication and collaboration mechanisms can lead to misunderstanding, delay and even project failure.
- **Diversity of user needs**：Platform Engineers usually need to support multiple teams that may have different needs and priorities.In some cases, these needs may be conflicting or limited in resources to meet all needs simultaneously.This requires the platform engineers to be sensitive and flexible in their management priorities, balancing interests and interests.
- **Cumulative technical debts**：may become more complex over time, especially when new tools and technologies are introduced.If platform engineers do not have enough time and resources to maintain and upgrade the platform, technical debt will accumulate over time, which may eventually become difficult to manage and maintain.This would not only reduce the effectiveness of the platform, but could also affect the efficiency of the work of the development team.
- **Cultural and customary changes** The success of the：platform project depends on cultural change across the organization, which means that team members must accept new tools, processes and working methods.Changing existing habits and mindsets is often difficult, especially when teams are accustomed to using traditional tools and methods.Moving this change forward will require time, patience and strong leadership support.

## What does the Platform Engineer do?

Platform engineers are responsible for deploying and maintaining internal developer platforms, which often have a deep understanding of software engineering practices and the way software developers operate.In addition, they understand what is delivered in the team and the tools and workflows needed to achieve these objectives.They also have experience using various DevOps tools and practices.

Simply put, platform engineers are like logistical support from software development teams, ensuring that developers have a strong, user-friendly tool and environment so that developers can focus on producing high-quality codes without fear of other things.

## What is the relationship between the platform project and DevOps?

Platform project is closely related to DevOs.Many platform engineers from DevOps background.DevOps is a practice that helps businesses deliver software faster and more efficiently, emphasizing collaboration between development and shipping teams.

The platform works draw on many of DevOps' same principles, including automation, continuing delivery and continuous integration.

The difference between the platform works and DevOps is that the platform works are building tools to help engineers and DevOps perform their tasks.Tool creation is usually not a focus of DevOps or, if the tool is created, it is temporary.

## Who needs platform engineering skills?

If your team is developing software, you are likely to need platform engineering skills to help your software development team speed up.Integrated development platforms are increasingly common and are being used to help speed up the work of some of the world's most disruptive and adaptive software development teams.

Platform engineering is a matter for all organizations that consider implementing DevOps.As businesses strive to deliver the software more quickly, they need processes and engineers who can enable their software development teams rather than hinder them.

When making decisions, remember DevOps counter-models.First, ask you whether you can successfully implement DevOps.If not, an internal developer platform and platform project may be your correct choice.

## Platform project based on Rainbond

After understanding the core elements of the platform project, then a brief description of how to use tools such as Rainbond to achieve platform engineering?

Rainbond is an application-centred cloud application management platform without learning from Kubernetes and Rainbond offers a range of functions to support platform engineering practices.Below are a few key points： on how Rainbond can help implement the platform project.

- **Simplifying App Management**：Rainbond provides a centralized management platform for developers through its App Center and App Store.Developers can manage their applications in a single interface, from deployment to monitoring, from environmental configuration to ability to expand applications.This centralization reduces the need for developers to switch between different tools and thus increases efficiency.

- **Automated workflows**：Developers are able to easily deploy their apps, from source code to running. Developers do not need to create, manage CI/CD processes, help teams automate, test, and deploy processes.Through automation, the development team can focus on code writing, while platform engineers can configure and maintain these automated processes through Rainbond, ensuring the reliability and consistency of the entire process.

- **Unified environmental management**：Rainbond offers flexible environmental management functions that can easily be created and managed by developers (e.g. development, testing, production environment).This flexibility allows teams to quickly iterate and test applications without fear of inconsistency between environments.

- **Simplified Kubernetes integration**：Rainbond abstracts the complexity of Kubernetes so that developers can easily manage cloud native apps without gaining insight into Kubernetes.Platform engineers can build a stable and efficient development platform for development teams using the tools offered by Rainbond, while developers can focus on the implementation of the application logic.

* **Cloud and blend support**：Rainbond supports deployment across multiple cloud platforms and mixed cloud environments, which is particularly important for businesses that need to switch between different cloud service providers or use multiple cloud services simultaneously.Platform engineers can manage resources in different cloud environments uniformly through Rainbond, reducing managerial complexity.
* **Integrated Development Tools**：Rainbond provides seamless integration with a wide range of development tools and services so that developers can use the tools they know directly on the platform.Both in terms of code management, continuous integration and monitoring tools, Rainbond provided extensive support and further simplified the workflow of developers.
* **Support for Microservice Framework**：Rainbond provides comprehensive support for Microservice Structures, and developers can easily manage and expand their microservices applications.Platform engineers can ensure stability and efficiency of inter-service communications through microservice governance functions in Rainbond, while providing troubleshooting and automatic recovery capabilities.
* ......

Through these functions, Rainbond provides a powerful and flexible toolkit for the implementation of the platform project.Platform engineers can use these tools to create an integrated, efficient and secure internal developer platform that helps firms speed up software development processes.

## Last

In sum, platform engineering has given new impetus to enterprise software development, helping development teams to remain agile and efficient in an increasingly complex technological environment.If your team is seeking better development processes and tools support, platform engineering is undoubtedly a worthwhile solution.Through the right tools and methods, platform engineering can be a key factor in business success.

In this way, both the development team and the enterprise can reap significant benefits from the platform project, focusing on innovation and business growth, rather than being caught in the management dilemma of tools and processes.
