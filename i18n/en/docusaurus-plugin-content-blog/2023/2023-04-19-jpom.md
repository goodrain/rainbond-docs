Rainbond and Jpom combine to achieve homogeneous management of cloud native and local projects, eg:：

- Use Rainbond to deploy and manage Jpom
- Can build containable cloud native projects with Jpom and deploy on Rainbond
- Manage some traditional items that cannot be contained, as well as deploy with Jpom
- Manage Rainbond cluster servers via Jpom and can be used as a fortress
- Use Jpom to manage scripts, execute scripts, time scripts, etc.

## Deploy Jpom

#### 3. Add build task

Go to `Function Manager -> Build -> Build List `Add：

- Custom name：

- Source repository：selects repository information created by step

- Branch：master

- How to build：locally.

- Build Command：

  ```bash
  mvn clean package
  ```

- Product directory：`target/java-maven-demo-0.0.1.jar`

- Select SSH for release action：

- Publish SSH：Select SSH to configure first step

- Release directory：selects the configured directory `/home/zq`,`java` is the project running directory

- The pre-release command：is generally used for stopped processes.

```bash
Tag="java-maven-demo"

pid=$(ps -ef | grep -v 'grep' | egrep $Tag| awk '{printf $2 " "}')
if [ "$pid" != "" ]; then      
  echo -n "boot ( pid $pid) is running" 
  echo 
  echo -n $"Shutting down boot: "
  pid=$(ps -ef | grep -v 'grep' | egrep $Tag| awk '{printf $2 " "}')
  if [ "$pid" != "" ]; then
    echo "kill boot process"
    # kill  "$pid"
    kill -9 "$pid"
  fi
else 
    echo "boot is stopped" 
fi
```

- Command：after release is generally used to start a project.

```bash
nohup java -Dapplication=java-maven-demo -jar /home/zq/java/java-mava-maven-demo-0.0.1.jar > /dev/null 2> &1 &
```

All other defaults, save and build.
