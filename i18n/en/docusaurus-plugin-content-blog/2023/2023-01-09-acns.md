## About ACNS

Dragon Dragon Native SuiteCRM [OpenAnolis Cloud Native Suite](https://openanolis.cn/sig/cloud-native) (ACNS) is an integrated Kubernetes version based on Kubernetes released by SIG of the Dragon Community Native SIG and can provide a one-key, open box deployment, and a rich cloud origin base, consisting mainly of：

![](https://oss.openanolis.cn/sig/opwbwqsjojsqmukskjhm)

- Kubernetes are based on ACK-D as an open source distribution and as a downstream of ACK; ACK-D is validated on a large scale of production to ensure the stability and reliability of components; and also support Calico, Hybirdnet on network plugins, and overlay and Underlay, which can be deployed to Underlay mode to allow POD IP to be directly externally accessed while providing better performance; storage plugins support local storage OpenLocal, using LVM to provide flexible local disk capability, and shared storage Minio.
- Runtime supports runC, runD and Kata, as well as runE (future version) for use in a variety of shared, segregated and secure scenarios.
- Mirror management provides open boxes for Nydus + Dragonfly. Using Nydus to load images within clusters can significantly increase the ability of clusters to dynamic resilience; Dragonfly is the ability to provide mirrors in clusters of P2P that are mainly geared to the Kubernetes cluster providing Serverless services, and dynamic elasticity scenarios, the AI data mirror images distribution scenes etc.

## About Rainbond

[Rainbond](https://www.rainbond.com/docs/) is a cloud native application management platform that is simple and does not require knowledge of containers, Kubernetes and substrate technologies, supports managing multiple Kubernetes clusters and manages enterprises applying life cycles.

## ACNS Combined with Rainbond

Dragon Dragon Native Kit ACNS provides a one-click ability to deploy clusters, Rainbond provides a one-click ability to deploy applications, Rainbond with Dragon Native Kit ACNS provides a one-stop cloud experience with：

- The infrastructure：Anolis OS is a fully open-source, neutral, open distribution by the OpenAnolis community that supports a multi-computing architecture, optimized for cloud scenes and compatible with CentS software ecology.
- Container layer：Dragonfly ACNS provides a large production certified ACK-D cluster, as well as a secure Kata operation, Dragonfly file distribution, and an acceleration of Nydus mirrors.
- Application layer：Rainbond provides open box capabilities for app development, market, micro-service architecture, app delivery, app viz, and more.

| Anolis OS 8.6 ANCK | 172.31.98.242 |

### Deployed Dragon Cantonal ACNS

Download `sealer` executable on any node

```bash
wget -c https://cloud-native.oss-n-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/bin/amd64/sealer-latest-linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -xvf sealer-latest-linux-amd64.tar.gz -C /usr/bin
```

Use `sealer` to download cluster image

```bash
sealer null cloud-nation-registry.cn-shanghai.cr.aliyuncs.com/kubernetes/anoliscluster:v1.0
```

Define the `Clusterfile` file` file,`Clusterfile`to define the cluster information, such as：node IPs, arguments, etc. deploy the cluster using`Clusterfile\` one clock.

```yaml
$ vim Clusterfile

apiVersion: sealer.cloud/v2
kind: Cluster
metata:
  name: my-cluster# Custom cluster name
spec:
  image: cloud-native-registry.cn-shanghai.cr.aliyuncs.com/kubertes/anoliscluster:v1.
  env:
    - ContainerRuntime=containerd # while running using containerd
    - SkipPreflight=true
    - SupportKata=true # Using Kata container
    - SupportNydudus=true # Using Nydus
    - SupportDragonfly=true # Using Dragonfly
    - YodaDevice=/dev/vdb# # # of Node nodes not used, Data
  ssh:
    passwd: xxxx# root ssh password
  hosts:
    - ips: [ 172. 1.98.243 ] # master IPS
      roles: [ master ]
    - ips: [ 172. 1.98.242] # node IPS
      roles: [ node ]
```

Start deployment of ACNS

```bash
sealer apply -f Clusterfile
```

#### Configure Dragonfly

Configure Containerd with Dragonfly, Mirror, in Containerd, following：

```toml
$ vim /etc/containerd/config.toml

[plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".registry]
  [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".registry.mirrors]
    [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".registry.mirrors."docker.io"]
      endpoint = ["http://127.0.0.1:65001","https://registry-1.docker.io"]
    [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".registry.mirrors."sea.hub:5000"]
      endpoint = ["http://127.0.0.1:65001","https://sea.hub:5000"]
      [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".registry.configs."sea.hub:5000".tls]
        insecure_skip_verify = true
```

Restart Containerd after completion of the configuration.

```bash
systemctl start containerd
```

### Deployment of Rainbond on ACNS

Modify the cluster Coredns configuration so that the `sea.hub` private mirror repository can be used in the cluster

```yaml
$ kubectl edit cm coredns - n kube-system

apiVersion: v1
data:
  Corefile: |
    . 53 LO
        hosts LO
          172. 1.98.443 sea. ub
          fallthrough
        }
    }

# Restart Coredns POD
$ kubectl delete pod -l k8s-app=kube-dns -n kube-system
```

#### Use Helm to deploy Rainbond

Create `rbd-system` namespace

```bash
kubectl create namespace rbd-system
```

Add Rainbond Helm repository

```bash
help repo add rainbond https://openchart.goodrain.com/goodrain/rainbond
```

Execute Helm command to install Rainbond and specify mirror repository information, reuse sealer's registry

```bash
helm install rainbond rainbond/rainbond-cluster -n rbd-system \
--set Cluster.imageHub.enable=true \
--set Cluster.imageHub.domain=sea.hub:5000 \
--set Cluster.imageHub.namespace=rainbond \
--set Cluster.imageHub.username=sealer \
--set Cluster.imageHub.password=sealer
```

Installation successful when the name `rbd-app-ui` POD contains `rbd-app-ui` for Running state.POD `rbd-app-ui-xxxxx-xxx` states that Rainbond was installed successfully.

Copy the commands below to be executed in the cluster, and get the platform access address.If there are multiple gateway nodes, any address can be accessed to the console.

```bash
kubectl get rainbondcluster rainbondcluster -n rbd-system -o go-template --template='{{range.spec.gatewayIngressIPs}}{{.}}:7070{{printf "\n"}}{{end}}'
```

## Last

In the future, Rainbond will work more closely with the Dragon Native ACNs to provide users with the best one-stop cloud experience.
