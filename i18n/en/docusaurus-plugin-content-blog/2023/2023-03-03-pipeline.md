Rainbond itself has the ability to build components based on the source code that can be compiled into a Docker image in multiple programming languages, but in the process of continuous integration it is often necessary to perform static checks, build packages, and test units.Previously, because Rainbond did not have an organized mechanism such as Piperine, users were often able to only integrate external CI such as Jenkins, Gitlab CI etc.This increases the threshold for developer use.

So to help developers test code better, compile caches, and even code quality analysis, in combination with Rainbond plugin systems, outreach information is made more flexible and diversified based on GitLab CI capabilities.

## Waterline Plugin

### Function

Based on Rainbond plugin system, the main plug plugin to extend information contributions includes the following five parts：

1. Waterline Administration: Developers use the Waterline Module to customize the flow line required for the application service and the stages of the line

2. Application Service: Application service is a repository for a project on Gitlab that is applied to development, managing the repository.Normally corresponded to components in Rainbond, which may correspond to more than one Rainbond component if multiple miniservices are included in a warehouse.

3. Code: Manage the continuous integration process between branches and CI in the repository to see historical information about recent submissions and continuous integration of branches in the repository branch.

4. Mirror Repository: Continuous integration of image products and versions are displayed here, and the generated mirrors can be deployed manually to the specified environment.

5. Deploy History: Mirror repository version deployed to history records under Rainbond app, can jump from deployment details to the corresponding component manager.

### Install

The streaming plugin has been posted to the Marketplace and can be installed by one click in the Open Source App Store.Current plugin needs to meet the following prerequisites：

- Rainbond v5.12.0
- Available Gitlab and Gitlab Runner

Gitlab and Gitlab runner can also be installed via the Open Source Store at one key.The installation process below：

1. Search for `Gitlab` and `Gitlab runner` in the `Platform Manager - Marketplace - Open Source Store`;
2. Search for the `Pipeline` installation in the `Platform Admin - Marketplace - Open Source Store`;

Specific configuration and usage reference：[Pipeline Use Document](https://www.rainbond.com/docs/devops/pipeline/)

### Use

Once the plugin is running, come back to the team view to refresh it. You can see the `Rainbond Stream Line` option in the left sidebar. Tap to enter.The flow line plugin uses the process mainly as shown in the graph below and is divided into four moves：`Create a streaming line template, >Create an application service -> Build->Deploy to Platform`.

#### Create Waterline Template

Users can define the stages of the water line in the template. By default, they provide a hydrological template for NodeJS, Java, Go, Python, which can customize each stage of the water line internally.

#### Create App Service

We need to create an application service after having a plug template.The application service actually connects the code repository and the plug template and eventually implements the code of the repository to be built through the streaming line template.

#### Build Code

Manually triggers stream line construction in `Code Management -> Branch `. Build processes that can be seen in `Code Management -> Continuous Integration`.Once constructed, the mirror will be pushed to the mirror repository address defined in the Waterline Template.Imaging products can be viewed in the mirror repository.

#### Deployment operations

Once the first build has been completed, the mirror information can be viewed in the mirror repository, at which time the deployment is chosen, the app can be selected from the team. The name of the component will be defined by the name of the application service.Once deployed, the deployment details can be seen in the deployment history. Click for details to jump to the corresponding component management, and then automatically build and deploy with the next submission.
