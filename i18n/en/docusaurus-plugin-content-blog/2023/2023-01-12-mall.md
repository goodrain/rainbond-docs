Many small partners will spend long on deployment while learning all electric merchants. Although many deployment methods are available, such as `deployment mall` on Linux, `using Docker or DockerCompose deployment mall`, we are all learning more complex and need to understand and learn about these container technologies.This paper will use Rainbond to deploy all electric and commercial projects and will allow us to focus on code through Rainbond of deploying Mall Mall, a cloud native application management platform that is simple and does not need to understand containers, Kubernetes and substrate complex technologies, easily deploy applications on Kubernetes and experience the capabilities offered by Kubernetes.

This paper describes two ways of deploying mall e-commerce projects on Rainbond：

1. Rapid deployment of all via Rainbond Open Source Store
2. Start deploying all services for all projects from 0

## Prerequisite

Install available Rainbond environment on Linux, Mac, Win, see [Rainbond Quick Installation] (https://www.rainbond.com/docs/quick-start/quick-install)

## Quickly deploy mall via App Store

The mall Electric Project has been released to the Rainbond Open Source App Store. You can deploy through the Open Source Store to search for `mall` and install it in \*\*Platform Manager -> Marketplace -> Open Source Store \*\* .

Hold Rainbond will automatically build and start mall services, just wait until the deployment is complete and sketch the following：

Visit the `mall-admin-web` front-end project validation, default user password：`admin / macro123`

`mall-portal` and `mall-search` are temporarily without a frontend and can access the swagger authentication `http://xxx/swagger-ui/`, as follows:：

## Launch mall from zero

### Intermediate deployment

The mall needs to be used with an：`Mysql` `Reddis` `RabbitMQ` `MongoDB` `ElasticSearch`, all of which can be deployed through the Rainbond Open Source App Store.

#### Install Redis

Search Redis in Open Source Store and install 5.x

#### Install MongoDB

Search MongoDB in Open Source Store and install 4.x

#### Install RabbitMQ

Search RabbitMQ in open source store and install

#### Install MySQL

Search MySQL in open source store and install 5.7

1. Open external port service on Mysql **component -> port** via IP:PORT and default user password `root / root`
2. Connect via tool and import mall sql data.

#### Install ElasticSearch

Search ElasticSearch in Open Source Store and install version 7.15.2

- The ElasticSearch app contains Kinbana and delete Kinbana components if not required
- ElasticSearch enabled password validation by default. Set `xpack.security.enabled` to `false` on **Component -> Environment Configuration -> Configuration -> Configuration Settings** and update the component to take effect.

**Install Chinese dictionary IK Analyzer**

1. First **Team View -> Plugins -> Add Plugins -> Install Plugins -> Install Plugins from App Store** Search for `ES-IK-Analysis` and Install Plugins
2. Add storage to ElasticSearch component,**Component -> Storage -> Add Storage**
   - Custom name：
   - Mount path：`/usr/share/elasticsearch/plugins`
   - Type：shared storage
3. Go to **Component -> Plugins -> Not Only**, open the `ES-IK-Analysis` plugin
4. Update or restart the ElasticSearch component to take effect.

### Deployment all backend services

#### Modify project code configuration

The `execution` section of the main `pom.xml` file does not need to configure the Docker packing item in the project, work to Rainbond handling, `pom.xml` configuration as follows：

```xml
<!-- 
<execution>
  <id>build-image</id>
  <phase>package</phase>
  <goals>
    <goal>build</goal>
  </goals>
</execution>
->
```

修改 mall-admin 服务的 `application-dev.yml` 文件，内容如下：

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://${MYSQL_HOST}:${MYSQL_PORT}/${MYSQL_DATABASE}?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=utf-8&serverTimezone=Asia/Shanghai&useSSL=false #MySQL连接地址
    username: ${MYSQL_USERNAME} #MySQL用户
    password: ${MYSQL_PWD} #MySQL密码
  ......
  redis:
    host: ${REDIS_HOST} #Redis连接地址
  ......
```

Modify the `application-dev.yml` file of the mall-portal service as follows：

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://${MYSQL_HOST}:${MYSQL_PORT}/${MYSQL_DATABASE}?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=utf-8&serverTimezone=Asia/Shanghai&useSSL=false #MySQL连接地址
    username: ${MYSQL_USERNAME} #MySQL用户
    password: ${MYSQL_PWD} #MySQL密码
  ......
  data:
    mongodb:
      host: ${MONGODB_HOST} #MySQL连接地址为环境变量
      port: 27017
      database: mall-port
  redis:
    host: ${REDIS_HOST} #Redis服务器地址
  ......
  rabbitmq:
    host: ${AMQP_HOST} #RabbitMQ 连接地址
    virtual-host: ${RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_VHOST} #RabbitMQ virtual host
    username: ${RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER} #RabbitMQ 用户
    password: ${RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS} #RabbitMQ 密码
  ......
```

Modify the `application-dev.yml` file for the mall-search service, as follows:：

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://${MYSQL_HOST}:${MYSQL_PORT}/${MYSQL_DATABASE}?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=utf-8&serverTimezone=Asia/Shanghai&useSSL=false #MySQL连接地址
    username: ${MYSQL_USERNAME} #MySQL用户
    password: ${MYSQL_PWD} #MySQL密码
  ......
  elasticsearch:
    uris: ${ES_HOST}:${ES_PORT} #ElasticSearch连接地址
  ......
```

Why should be changed to an environmental variable, as this is more flexible, so simply by modifying the simple variable configuration that allows the mall project to run in any environment.And in Rainbond, when a dependency is established between components, the environmental variable is automatically injected into the dependent component so that we are not even configured and easier to read [the environmental variable injection between Rainbond components] (https://www.rainbond.com/docs/microservice/service-mesh/connection_env).

#### Deploy backend components

Create a component from source in team view or app view **newly:**

- Component name：Custom
- Component English Name：Custom
- Repository address：`https://github.com/zzzhangqi/mall.git`
- Code Version：master

> The above repository has modified the above code configuration

Rainbond will detect projects for multi-module projects, build：select `mall-admin, mall-portal, mall-search` and build it.

Enter -> Ports, Delete Default 5000 Ports, Add New Component Port：

- mall-admin：8080
- mall - Portal：8085
- mall-search：8081

#### Create dependencies between components

In the app, switch to edit mode, follow the following dependencies and establish connection to：

Add dependency between components

### Deployment all front-end services

In many cases, our backend service is generally not accessible externally. If the current configuration is used, the backend address in `config/prod.env.js` must be the same as the front-end access address if it does not produce cross-domain as below：

```js
module.exports = LO
  NODE_ENV: 'production',
  BASE_API: 'https://admin-api.xx.com'
}
```

How to avoid exposing backend services while resolving cross-domain can use Nginx back-end services.

Define an non-existent interface in `config/prod.env.js` such as `/api`

```js
module.exports = LO
  NODE_ENV: 'production',
  BASE_API: '/api'
}
```

For example, the URL of the login interface is `/api/admin/login` at the frontend, `/api` is not our interface, `/admin/login`, then rewrite `/api` with the Nginx URL. Access to the interface `/admin/login` is the correct interface, and can solve the cross-domain problem while the backend service is not exposed.

```
server
    listen 80;

    location / FUM
      root / app/www;
      index index. tml index. tm;
    }

    location/api LO
        rewrite ^/api/(. )$ /$1 break;
        proxy_pass http:///127.0.0.1:8080;
    }
}
```

#### Deploy Frontend Component

Create a component from source in team view or app view **newly:**

- Component name：Custom
- Component English Name：Custom
- Repository address：`https://github.com/zzzhangqi/mall-admin-web.git`
- Code Version：master

> The above repository has already been added

Add `mall-admin-web` depends on `mall-admin`

### Verify deployment

Visit the `mall-admin-web` frontend project validation deployment, default user password：admin / macro123.`mall-portal` and `mall-search` are temporarily without a frontend and can access the swagger authentication `http://xxx/swagger-ui/`

## Last

The next issue will be the deployment of mall-swarm micro-service project practices on Rainbond
