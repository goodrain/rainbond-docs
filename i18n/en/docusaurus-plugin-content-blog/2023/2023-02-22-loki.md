Loki is an open source log aggregation system developed by Grafana Labs to provide efficient log processing solutions for cloud native structures.

Looki stores and queries log data through the use of Prometheus label indexing mechanisms, which enables it to quickly carry out distributed queries and aggregates without loading all data from storage to memory.Loki also uses compression and cutting of log data to reduce the use of storage space and thus better adapts to the high growth of log data in cloud-origin environments.

Loki的架构由以下几个主要组件组成：

**Promptail:** Collect application and system log data and send them to the Loki cluster.

**Loki:** stores log data, provides log queries for HTTP API, and data filtering and filtering.

**Grafana:** Responsible UI to display log data.

## Looki vs ELK

Loki and ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) are common log systems, each with some advantages.Below are several strengths of Looki relative to ELK：

- More efficient storage：Loki uses compression and cutting log data methods to reduce storage usage compared to ELK needs to maintain a large index and require more storage.

- Query speed is faster：Loki stores and queries log data using a Prometheus tagged indexer system, which enables it to quickly distribute queries and aggregates without loading all data from storage to memory.The ELK would need to load data from storage into memory for query, which is relatively slow.

- Deployment and management is easier：Loki is a lightweight log aggregation system than ELK needs to deploy and manage multiple components, requiring more resources and manpower.

## Install and configure Loki

### Prerequisite

See the [Rainbond Quick Installation](https://www.rainbond.com/docs/quick-start/quick-install) document for installation.

### Install Looki

The `Loki` app has been published to the Open Source App Store and can be installed via the Open Source Store button.

Search for `Loki` in \*\*Platform Admin -> Marketplace -> Open Source Store \*\* and install.

Once installed, the app contains `Loki` `Grafana` component：

There are also resources in `k8s`, including `Daemonset` and `SA` in the form of `compromis`.

### Configure Looki

Enter **In-app -> k8s resource**, modify the `url` section of ConfigMap `prompt-config`, URL obtained via Look's **component -> Port -> Access Address** as follows:：

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  prompt.yaml: |
    clients:
    - url: http://gre4f2a2:3100/loki/api/v1/push # Changed
...
```

Go to **In-app -> k8s resource**, modify the `namespace` section of ClusterRoleBinding `prompt-clusterrolebinding` as the namespace of the current application.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: Proton-clusterrolebinding
. ...
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: prompt-serviceaccount
  namespace: dev # Changed
```

If Containerd is running while the container is running, it does not need to modify the `prompt-daemonset` resource, or if the container is Docker when it is running.

```yaml
....
volumeMounts:
- mountPath: /var/lib/containers # Changed
  name: varlibdocker Containers
  readOnly: true
... .
volumes:
- hostPath:
    path: /var/lib/containers # Changed
    type: ""
  name: varlibdockercontainers
```

Update the `Loki` component with modifications, in-app -> updates.

## Use Looki

Visit the `Grafana`. Use the Access button inside the app to access `Grafana` via the domain name provided by Rainbond by default.

Enter `Explore` to filter POD logs via Labels and select `namespace` `pod` Labels that automatically generate query expressions. Tap Show logs to view the log.

### Query expression

In addition to selecting Labels via the Grafana interface, you can manually search for expressions like：

```bash
{container="rbd-api",namespace="rbd-system",pod="rbd-api-5fdd795546-j5679"}
```

The following tag matching operator： is currently supported

- `=` equals
- `!= `Not equal to
- `=~` regular match
- `!~` regular does not match

e.g.：

```bash
{namespace="dev|rbd-system"}
```

## Last

In sum, Loki is a lightweight and efficient log aggregation system that has performed well in processing mass log data in cloud creatures.Looki is more efficient than ELK, faster searching, deployment and management easier.Combining Rainbond to work together makes our application and log management very simple.
