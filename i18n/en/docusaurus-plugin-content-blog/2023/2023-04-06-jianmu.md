[建木](https://gitee.com/jianmu-dev/jianmu) is an open source (graphicalization)/low code (GitOps) tool for easy extension of DevOps to help users organize various DevOps processes and distribute them to different platforms.

The graphical layout of the wood provides multiple nodes, which can define the action to be performed by the step, and the user can freely combine the water line through multiple nodes.Rainbond community participated in the development of the Wood node and contributed **Rainbod component creation and continuous deployment** node.Users can use this node to automatically create components and continuously deploy components in Rainbond

Wood apps can be deployed by one click on the open source store through Rainbond to make the deployment easier and extend the Rainbond build system as an application plugin.

The figure below is the final result and the graphical hydrological line configuration of the wood. The flow chart below is presented as an example in：

1. Clone Item Source
2. Build a project using Maven
3. Build Docker Image
4. Automatically create components and deploy them on Rainbond

## Deploying Rainbond with Wood

### Rainbond deployment

[Rainbond](https://www.rainbond.com/) is a cloud native application management platform that uses simple and does not require knowledge of containers, Kubernetes and substrate complex technologies, supports managing multiple Kubernetes clusters and manages enterprises applying life cycles.

Available at [基于主机安装Rainbond](https://www.rainbond.com/docs/installation/installation-with-ui/) for installation.

### Wood deployment

Install Wood Apps via Rainbond Open Source Store at \*\*Platform Admin -> Marketplace -> Open Source Store \*\* for installation.

## Wood Usage

Demo will be demonstrated through a Java SpringBoot Demo project, project address：https://gitee.com/zhangbigqi/java-maven-demo

### Configure Graphics Fluid

Visit the Wooden UI to enter the graphics project.

1. Add the `git clone` node and configure the git address.

3. Search for `rainbond`, add `build docker mirror -rainbond` node and configure it.

- Configure docker users and passwords to push mirrors.You need to add this to the **Homepage -> Key Manager**.
- Configure image name.
- Specify the registry address to push mirrors.
- Configure the directory to execute the build command, select the `git clone`.

4. Search for `rainbond`, add the `rainbod component to create and deploy` node and configure it.

- **Rainbond URL:** Rainbond visit address such as：http://192.168.1.1:7070
- **Rainbond Token:** Generate Token in `Rainbond Console -> Personal Center -> Access Token`.
- **Rainbond team ID:** For example, enter a development team at http://192.168.1.1:7070/#/team/e2h5j3d8/region/rainbond/index, `e2h5j3d8` is the team ID.
- **Rainbond cluster ID:** For example, enter a development team, at which time the URL is http://192.168.1.1:7070/#/team/e2h5j3d8/region/rainbond/index, `rainbond` is the cluster ID.
- **Rainbond Application ID:** For example, enter a test app for a development team at http://192.168.1.1:70/#/team/e2h5j3d8/region/rainbond/apps/5, `5` is the app ID.
- **Mirror Address:** Select the next step `Image Name:Image Tag`.
- **Component Name:** Component Name on Rainbond e.g.：`java-test`.

### Run Graphic Fluid

Saves the line configuration and triggers the line execution. Wait until the line is implemented.

Once the pipeline has been executed, enter Rainbond test app and see components created successfully.Then enter the component to add the `5000` port and open the external service to access it, verify that the service is correct.

## Last

There is, of course, a higher level playing method. Wood supports the definition of [Workflow](https://docs.jianmu.dev/guide/flow-dsl.html#workflow), workflow supports peers, serial lines and so forth, but workflows can only be edited through DSL to define workflows through code items.
