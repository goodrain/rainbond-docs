Curve is a modern storage system that is easily accessible by the web and currently supports file storage (CurveFS) and block storage (CurveBS).

CurveBS Core App Scenarios include primarily：

- performance type, mix, capacity cloud or persistent volume of the virtual machine/container, as well as remote disk of the physical machine
- High performance separation architecture：is based on the RDMA+SPDK high-performance extension architecture that supports various databases such as MySQL, kafka and other types of inventory separation of deployments, and increases case delivery efficiency and resource utilization

CurveFS Core App Scenes include primarily：

- High Price Storage in AI Training (including Machine Learning)
- Cold thermal data automation stratification storage in large data scenes
- Shared files with high value in public cloud storage：can be used for business scenes like AI, Big Data, File Sharing etc.
- Mixed cloud storage：thermal data stored in local IDC, cold data stored in public cloud

## Use CurveAdm to deploy CurveFS

CurveAdm is a tool designed by the Curve team to improve system ease and is primarily used for rapid deployment and delivery of the CurveBS/CurveFS cluster.Main Feature：

- Quick Deployment CurveBS/CurveFS Cluster
- Containment services
- Transport CurveBS/CurveFS Cluster
- Manage clusters at the same time
- Upgrade 1 click
- Wrong exact location

### Install CurveAdm

```bash
bash -c "(curl -fsSL https://curveadm.nos-eastchina1.126.net/script/install.sh)"
```

### Hosts list

The host module is used to manage the host in a uniform manner so as to reduce the user to rewrite the host's `SSH` connection configuration in each configuration file.We need to import the list of machines needed to deploy clusters and clients in order to fill in the hostname of the deployment service in subsequent categories of configurations.

Use a server here for single node clusters.

#### Configure decrypted login

Generate the key and configure the server to decrypt login

```bash
# Enjoy enough to
ssh-keygen

# Configuring
ssh-copy-id with ssh-copy-id root@172.31.98.243

# Verify decryption
ssh root@172.31.98.243

# No password login required
```

#### Import host list

Preparing host list file `hosts.yaml`

```yaml
$ vim hosts. aml

global:
  user: root # ssh free login username
  ssh_port: 22 # ssh port
  private_key_file: /root/. sh/id_rsa # key path

hosts:
  - host: curve
    hostname: 172.31.98.243
```

Import host list

```bash
$ curveadm hosts commit hosts.yaml
```

View host list

```bash
$ curveadm hosts
```

### Preparing group pop files

CurveFS supports one-machine deployment and high-availability deployment, where we use one-machine deployment certification.

Create a `topology.yaml` file by simply changing the `target:curve`, other defaults.

```yaml
$ vim topology.yaml

kind: curvefs
global:
  report_usage: true
  data_dir: ${home}/curvefs/data/${service_role}${service_host_sequence}
  log_dir: ${home}/curvefs/logs/${service_role}${service_host_sequence}
  container_image: opencurvedocker/curvefs:v2.4
  variable:
    home: /tmp
    target: curve

etcd_services:
  config:
    listen.ip: ${service_host}
    listen.port: 2380${service_host_sequence}         # 23800,23801,23802
    listen.client_port: 2379${service_host_sequence}  # 23790,23791,23792
  deploy:
    - host: ${target}
    - host: ${target}
    - host: ${target}

mds_services:
  config:
    listen.ip: ${service_host}
    listen.port: 670${service_host_sequence}        # 6700,6701,6702
    listen.dummy_port: 770${service_host_sequence}  # 7700,7701,7702
  deploy:
    - host: ${target}
    - host: ${target}
    - host: ${target}

metaserver_services:
  config:
    listen.ip: ${service_host}
    listen.port: 680${service_host_sequence}           # 6800,6801,6802
    listen.external_port: 780${service_host_sequence}  # 7800,7801,7802
    global.enable_external_server: true
    metaserver.loglevel: 0
    braft.raft_sync: false
  deploy:
    - host: ${target}
    - host: ${target}
    - host: ${target}
      config:
        metaserver.loglevel: 0
```

### Deploy cluster

Add the `my-cluster` cluster and specify the cluster spotting file

```bash
curveadm cluster ad my-cluster -f topology.yaml
```

Toggle `my-cluster` cluster to manage the current cluster

```bash
curveadm cluster checkout my-cluster
```

Start deployment of cluster

```bash
$ curveadm strike
...
Cluster 'my-cluster' successfully employed ^_^.
```

The `Cluster `my-cluster' successfully deployed^_^.

View cluster performance

```bash
$ curveadm status

## Deployment of Rainbond

`Rainbond` is a cloud native application management platform that is simple and does not require knowledge of containers, Kubernetes and bottom complex technologies, supports managing multiple Kubernetes clusters, and manages corporate applications throughout their life cycle.

You can quickly install Rainbond single version by a command.

```bash
curl -o install.sh https://get.rainbond.com && cash ./install.sh
```

After executing the script, patience will wait for 3 to 5 minutes. You can see the log output below and indicate that Rainbond has started completion.

```bash
INFO: Rainbond started successfully, Please pass http://$EIP:7070 Access Rainbond
```

## Deployment of MinIO

Since CurveFS currently only supports S3 as backend storage, CurveBS backend will be supported. So we need to deploy a MinIO object storage.

Deploy MinIO or cluster MinIOs on a single machine using Rainbond open source store.Go to the \*\*Platform Manager -> Marketplace for Rainbond, search for `minio` in the Open Source Store for one click installation.

![](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/curve/2.png)

Once deployed, access to the MinIO console via domain name provided by Rainbond and default user password `minio/minio123456`.Then you need to create a Bucket for CurveFS.

## Deployment of CurveFS-CSI

- Prerequisite：Rainbond version to be in v5.13+

Deployed with Rainbond Open Source Store at one click to access Rainbond **Platform Manager -> App Market**, search `curve-csi` in the Open Source Store.

![](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/curve/3.png)

CurveFS-CSI does not have components of the Rainbond application model type, all belong to the k8s resource type and can be seen under **Apps View -> K8s Resources**.

![](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/curve/4.png)

Once installed, you need to change the name of `curvefs-csi-cluster-role-binding` and `curvefs-csi-role-binding` to the name of the current team, if the current team is `dev`, the following：

```yaml
# curvefs-csi-role-binding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metata:
  name: curvefs-csi-role-binding
...
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: curvefs-csi-service-account
  namespace: dev # changed

# curvefs-csi-cluster-role-binding
apiVersion: rbac. uthorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: curvefs-csi-cluster-role-binding
... ...
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: curvefs-csi-service-account
  namespace: dev # changed
```

Create `storageclass` resource in **App View -> k8s Resources -> Add**：

```bash
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: curvefs-Sc
provisioner: csi. urvefs.com
allow VolummeExpansion: false
reclaimPolicy: Delete
parameters:
  mdsAddr: "172. 1.98.243:6700, 172.31.98.243:6701,172.31.98.243:6702"
  fsType: "s3"
  s3Endpoint: "http://9000.grda6567.1frt0lmq. 836cf.grapps.cn"
  s3AccessKey: "minio"
  s3Secretaries: "minio123456"
  s3ucket: "curve"
```

- mdsAddr：obtained through the `curveadm status` command.

  ```bash
  $ curveadm status
  ...
  cluster mds addr : 172.31.98.243:6700, 172.31.98.243:6701,172.38.243:6702
  ```

- s3Endpoint：fill in the 9,000 port of the MinIO component for the external service domain.

- s3AccessKey：MinIO access key, use root or generate access key.

- s3SecretariesKey：MinIO key key, use root password or generate a secret.

- s3Bucket：MinIO bucket name.

## Use CurveFS on Rainbond

Create a Nginx component by mirror, modify component deployment type to `state-service` in **Component -> Other Settings**.On Rainbond only have status services that can use custom storage. The statelessness service uses default shared storage.

![](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/curve/6.png)

Go to **Component -> Storage** to add storage, select `curvefs-sc`, save and restart components.

![](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/curve/7.png)

Waiting for the component to enter the component web terminal, test write data.

![](https://static.goodrain.com/wechat/curve/8.png)

Then enter the MinIO drum to view it, the data is written.

## Future planning

In the future, Rainbond communities will use Curve Cloud Survival Storage as a shared storage at the bottom of Rainbond to provide users with a better and simpler cloud application management platform and cloud survival storage, together to promote open source community ecology and provide integrated solutions for users.
