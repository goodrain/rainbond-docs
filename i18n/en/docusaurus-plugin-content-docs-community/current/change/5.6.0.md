## Version Changes (5.5.0-5.6.0)

## Interpretation of main function points：

### 1. Support single-machine fast experience

In order to facilitate the rapid installation and experience of Rainbond on a single computer, the current version supports installation and experience through one command. The supported platforms now include：

- Linux
- Linux (ARM)
- Mac (Intel)
- Mac (M1)
- Windows

### 2. Support Helm installation method

Helm provides a set of simple and easy-to-use command lines to complete the installation, update, upgrade, rollback and other operations of the application with the help of the Charts package made by the developer.The current version adapts most of the Kubernetes types available on the market through Helm as a package management tool, these types include：当前版本通过 Helm 作为包管理工具适配了市面可见的大多数 Kubernetes 类型，这些类型包括：

- Various versions of standard Kubernetes clusters deployed using different installation tools (e.g. kubeadm, sealos);

- Kubernetes-as-a-service cloud products launched by major cloud service providers, such as Alibaba Cloud ACK, Tencent Cloud TKE, and Huawei Cloud CCE;

- Other container infrastructures based on Kubernetes specifications, such as Rancher, K3s, Kubedge;

### 3. Optimize the operating experience of the topology map

In the previous version, because Rainbond displayed many levels, when users operated a single component, they often needed to switch to the component view, which made the user operate with more levels and could not obtain the required information in the first time.This time, we optimized the display information of the topology map, so that it can give more information and operate at the application level.Reduce the operational burden of entering component views.这次我们针对拓扑图的展示信息做了优化，使其能在应用层级给出更多的信息，并进行操作。降低进入组件视图的操作负担。

The new version display information is as：

在新版本中，拓扑图展示信息处给出了一排组件操作按钮，分别是访问组件、进入Web终端、更新组件、关闭组件、删除组件。用户可以根据这些按钮快速操作组件，同时下方展示出了组件内的容器信息。极大的提升了用户的操作效率。

### 4. Add topology graph aggregation mode

在企业实际使用中，一个应用下的组件，往往会依赖其他应用下的组件，此时用户看到的拓扑图信息会大且比较杂乱，无法快速分辨其他组件所属的应用。这时对于用户而言，多个应用之间的依赖关系不明确。为了解决此问题，我们新增了拓扑图聚合模式。在这种情况下，可以更清晰的展示多个应用间的依赖关系。

In normal mode, you can see that the application depends on multiple components, but we are not clear about the relationship between these components.

We switch to aggregation mode, and we can see that the relationship between components and other applications is clear.

Click on the topology map of the Gitlab application, we can know the running status of the application and the information of the dependent components.

### 5. Support gateway path rewriting

Previously, the Rainbond gateway only implemented a simple location proxy, and did not provide functions related to route rewriting.When there is such a demand：当有这样的需求：

To access：http://example/abc/index.html by adding an extra virtual directory to the path of the target service http:{upstream}.Achieve the effect of http://example/abc/index.html => http://{upstream-1}/index.html.The corresponding gateway configuration is as follows.达到 http://example/abc/index.html => http://{upstream-1}/index.html 的效果。对应的网关配置如下。

```Nginx
location / {
    rewrite /abc(/|$)(.*) /$2 last;
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1;
}
```

Now we need to implement this complex rewrite configuration, just fill in the corresponding fields on the UI, as shown in the following figure：
