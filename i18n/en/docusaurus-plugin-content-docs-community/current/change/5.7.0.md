## Version Changes (5.6.0-5.7.0)

## Interpretation of main function points：

### 1. Plugin sharing and one-click installation

For the operation, maintenance and management capabilities of business containers, Rainbond implements a plug-in mechanism through the sidecar in the pod.Developers can develop plug-ins by themselves, and enable and configure plug-ins as needed according to business needs. The current plug-ins can already achieve：

- Extend the functionality of components without changing existing business code
- Complete some data initialization operations before the business runs
- Send business logs to external servers for analysis and processing
- Intercept the traffic of cleaning business and use it as a firewall
- Monitor business performance indicators, etc.

However, in the previous version, after a user created a plug-in under a team and needed to use it for another team, he needed to manually create it again and set the corresponding configuration items.This increases the threshold for users to use to a certain extent. Now, like apps, we can also support sharing and one-click installation of plug-ins after supporting the sharing and click installation of

applications.When you have made a plug-in available under a team, you can share it through Rainbond's local component library or open source application store.Other users can install and use it through component libraries and open source app stores.The advantage of this is that plug-ins can also be accumulated and reused like applications, and plug-ins developed by community users can also be shared with other users.

### 2. Extend the configuration capabilities of the plug-in

When the plugin itself needs a corresponding configuration file or storage, the user needs to manually add storage to the component.This is because the storage is shared between plugins and components, but when a plugin is used for multiple components, it is necessary to configure storage under each component, which causes configuration complexity. Now users can configure the storage and configuration files required by the plugin at runtime directly in the plugin.as shown below：

In this way, when the user activates the plug-in for the component, the corresponding storage and configuration file can be automatically created for the component.Reduced configuration complexity.



### 3. Support for docking with Ceph

Stable and reliable storage is the most important part of using Kubernetes in production.Kubernetes provides a mainstream storage volume access solution (In-Tree) by default, and also provides a plug-in mechanism (Out-Of-Tree) to allow access to third-party storage that implements the CSI interface. In the current version, by extending the CSI The ability can perfectly dock Ceph.
