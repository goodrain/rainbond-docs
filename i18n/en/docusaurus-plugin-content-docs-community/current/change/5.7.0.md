## Version Changes (5.6.0-5.7.0)

## Interpretation of main function points：

### 1. Plugin sharing and one-click installation

为了业务容器的运维和管理能力，Rainbond 通过pod中的sidecar实现了插件机制。开发者可以自己开发插件，并根据业务需要按需开启和配置插件，当前插件已经可以实现：

- Extend the functionality of components without changing existing business code
- Complete some data initialization operations before the business runs
- Send business logs to external servers for analysis and processing
- Intercept the traffic of cleaning business and use it as a firewall
- Monitor business performance indicators, etc.

但是，在之前的版本中，用户在某个团队下创建出插件后，需要给另一个团队使用时，还需要再次手动创建，设置对应的配置项。这在一定程度上增加了用户使用的门槛。
现在和应用一样，我们在支持[应用的分享](https://www.rainbond.com/docs/use-manual/app-store-manage/share-app)和一键安装后，也可以支持插件的分享和一键安装。applications.When you have made a plug-in available under a team, you can share it through Rainbond's local component library or open source application store.Other users can install and use it through component libraries and open source app stores.The advantage of this is that plug-ins can also be accumulated and reused like applications, and plug-ins developed by community users can also be shared with other users.其他用户可以通过组件库和开源应用商店安装使用。这样的好处是插件也可以像应用一样积累和复用，社区用户开发的插件也可以分享给其他用户使用。

### 2. Extend the configuration capabilities of the plug-in

When the plugin itself needs a corresponding configuration file or storage, the user needs to manually add storage to the component.This is because the storage is shared between plugins and components, but when a plugin is used for multiple components, it is necessary to configure storage under each component, which causes configuration complexity. Now users can configure the storage and configuration files required by the plugin at runtime directly in the plugin.as shown below：However, in the previous version, after a user created a plug-in under a team and needed to use it for another team, he needed to manually create it again and set the corresponding configuration items.This increases the threshold for users to use to a certain extent. Now, like apps, we can also support sharing and one-click installation of plug-ins after supporting the sharing and click installation of
现在用户可以直接在插件里配置插件运行时所需的存储和配置文件。如下图所示：

In this way, when the user activates the plug-in for the component, the corresponding storage and configuration file can be automatically created for the component.Reduced configuration complexity.减少了配置的复杂性。

### 3. Support for docking with Ceph

稳定可靠的存储是在生产环境中使用 Kubernetes 最重要的一环。Stable and reliable storage is the most important part of using Kubernetes in production.Kubernetes provides a mainstream storage volume access solution (In-Tree) by default, and also provides a plug-in mechanism (Out-Of-Tree) to allow access to third-party storage that implements the CSI interface. In the current version, by extending the CSI The ability can perfectly dock Ceph.
