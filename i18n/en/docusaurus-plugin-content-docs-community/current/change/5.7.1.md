## Version Changes (5.7.0-5.7.1)

## Interpretation of main function pointsï¼š

### 1. Support quick connection to multiple public clouds

In the previous version, it only supports connecting to Alibaba Cloud ACK cluster, which is not friendly enough for users who use other cloud vendors.In order to facilitate users to quickly connect to clusters of different public cloud vendors.We have optimized the installation process.It now supports connecting to clusters provided by Alibaba Cloud, Huawei Cloud, Tencent Cloud and other cloud vendors through helm. Users choose different cloud vendors, and can provide the configuration of related resources by themselves, and finally generate a complete installation command, which is executed in the cluster managed by the cloud vendor.When Rainbond's data center is installed, it will automatically connect to the console.You can manage multiple cloud service provider clusters in the console.

### 2. Support cluster exception alarm

Combined with user feedback, we found that users often encounter abnormal cluster communication problems in the console during use.Although it does not necessarily directly affect the business components running above.But for users, the inability to directly manage their own business is also a serious problem. At this time, users often need to manually go to the Kubernetes cluster to troubleshoot the problem.For example, when the resource usage in the cluster is excessive, the Pod is evicted or the node is abnormal, which may lead to this situation. In the past, we also provided Rainbond monitoring and alarm system, but with fewer users.Therefore, in order to facilitate users to understand the possible problems in advance.Based on the previous alarm rules, we display the alarm information on the page.So that the platform administrator can deal with related problems in a timely manner.
