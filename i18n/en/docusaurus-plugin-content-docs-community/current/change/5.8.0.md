title: v5.8.0-release
description: Describe the changes in versions 5.7.1-5.8.0
---

Rainbond is an "application-centric" cloud-native application management platform.Compared with other container management platforms, it provides an easier-to-use application management experience.This is an advantage, but on the other hand, due to the difference between the application-level abstraction and the actual Kubernetes resources, for many users who are already familiar with Kubernetes, using Rainbond will face the following three problems：相比于其他容器管理平台，提供了更易用的应用管理体验。Rainbond has limited support for Kubernetes resources.In some scenarios, it is difficult to implement scenarios such as environment variables referencing the value of a secret, adjusting Pod scheduling policies, and affinity configuration.

1. Rainbond 对 Kubernetes 资源支持有限。在某些场景下，如环境变量引用某个 Secret 的值、调整 Pod 的调度策略、亲和性配置等场景难以实现。

2. 在 Kubernetes 集群中已经部署的应用。An application that has been deployed in a Kubernetes cluster.How to migrate to Rainbond, many configurations need to manually adjust the deployment again.Migration costs are high.迁移成本高。

3. Existing Kubernetes Yaml files cannot be directly deployed on Rainbond.

In order to solve the above problems, we mainly made the following improvements in version：

1. For applications already running in a Kubernetes cluster, we support one-click import of all applications under the namespace.When the namespace to import is selected, we can see the resources under that namespace.We will distinguish applications according to [Kubernetes recommended label](https://kubernetes.io/zh-cn/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/common-labels/), and distinguish resources by application.As shown below: ![import-region-resource.png](https://grstatic.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/docs/5.8/community/change/import-region-resource.png)Support one-click import of existing applications in the Kubernetes cluster.We can directly import the existing applications in the cluster into Rainbond for management.

2. Compatible with the resources and attributes of Kubernetes, and supports the creation of various resources, such as PVC, PV, Secret, etc., through Yaml files under the application.The resources created under the application can be referenced in the component.Also supports publishing to application templates.在应用下创建的资源，可以在组件里进行引用。同时支持了发布到应用模版。

3. Support deploying components through Yaml files, we will convert the resources identified in the Yaml files into built-in components of Rainbond to achieve one-click deployment of Yaml files.

In general, in this release, Rainbond has gone a step further in its resource compatibility with Kubernetes' underlying resources, and many resources that were not supported before can also be created and used directly.The following is a brief introduction to the main functions of this version.下面简单介绍下本次版本的主要功能。

## Version changes (5.7.1-5.8.0)

## Interpretation of main function points：

### 1. Support one-click import of existing cluster applications

对于在Kubernetes集群中已经运行的应用，我们支持了一键导入命名空间下的所有应用。当选择好要导入的命名空间时，我们可以看到该命名空间下的资源。我们会根据 [Kubernetes 推荐标签](https://kubernetes.io/zh-cn/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/common-labels/)来区分应用，将资源按应用区分出来。如下图所示:
![import-region-resource.png](https://grstatic.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/docs/5.8/community/change/import-region-resource.png)

Among these resources, Deployment/Statefulset/Job/CronJob will be converted into built-in components. If other resources cannot correspond to the Rainbond abstract model, they will be converted into K8s resources under the application.After clicking Next, you can see the relationship between the previous resource and the Rainbond model.As shown below在点击下一步后，你可以看到之前的资源与 Rainbond 模型的关系。如下图所示

After the final import, you can manage your application in Rainbond's team.

### 2. Support deploying components through Yaml files

Many users write their own Yaml deployment applications. For the convenience of users, we also support deploying applications through Yaml.Different from other container management platforms, when deploying applications using Yaml files, we do not directly make the Yaml files take effect in the cluster, but convert them into our component types.So that users can use our application-level management functions after deployment, such as the full life cycle of components, component orchestration, release and installation, etc.In order to expand the capabilities of applications and components, as well as better Kubernetes-compatible resources.Under the application, we have added an entry for `K8s resource` , where various resources in the cluster can be deployed through Yaml.Such as PV, PVC, Service, Ingress, etc.The resources deployed here will be deployed directly to the cluster.What we define here is that it should be the basic environment your application needs to run.That is, the resources provided here should be used by the components under the current application.When published, the assets here are also published with the component.以便于用户在部署后，还能使用到我们应用级的管理功能，如组件的全生命周期、组件编排、发布安装等。

When adding components, upload your files after selecting Yaml to deploy.We will convert them into corresponding component models and application resources after identification, as shown in the following figureAlso under the other settings of the component, there is an item of Kubernetes properties.We can define some properties used by this component here, such as volumes, volumeMounts, etc.Here you can mount the `K8s resource`created under the application to expand the component capabilities.

### 3. Compatible with Kubernetes resources and properties

为了扩展应用和组件的能力，以及更好的兼容 Kubernetes 的资源。我们在应用下，新增了 `K8s 资源` 的入口，在这里可以通过 Yaml 部署集群中的各类资源。如 PV、PVC、Service、Ingress 等。在这里部署的资源均会直接被部署到集群中。这里我们定义的是，它应该是你应用运行所需要的基础环境。即这里提供的资源，应该是供当前应用下的组件进行使用的。在发布时，这里的资源也会和组件一起发布。

![k8s\_resources\_add.jpg](https://grstatic.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/docs/5.8/docs/yaml-helm-guide/k8s-resource/k8s_resources_add.jpg)

同样在组件的其他设置下，有 Kubernetes 属性这一项。我们可以在这里定义该组件使用到的一些属性，如 volumes、volumeMounts 等。这里可以挂载应用下创建的 `K8s 资源`，用于扩展组件能力。

### 4. Supports direct upload of Jar/War package build components

In previous versions, when users used Jar packages for delivery, we needed to create a git repository and push the Jar packages up before building.This brings up several problems：这会带来几个问题：

- Creating a new warehouse is cumbersome and difficult to deploy in an offline environment
- The git repository will limit the size of a single file. When the Jar package is too large, it cannot be uploaded

因此为了解决以上问题，我们支持直接上传 Jar/War 包构建组件。Therefore, in order to solve the above problems, we support directly uploading the Jar/War package to build components.As shown in the figure below, we can view the file name and the MD5 value of the file on the component overview page.To facilitate version differentiation when uploading files repeatedly.以便于在反复上传文件时区分版本。

Function detailed documentation reference: https://www.rainbond.com/docs/use-manual/component-create/package-support/jar-war

### 5. Support switching component build source

When we install a complete application from the application market, but some components in the application need to be replaced from source code and mirror image, then we need to modify the build source.That is to say, if I install an application and want to replace a component in it, I often can only create a new component and rearrange the dependencies.The operation is more complicated.Especially in the offline environment, when you find that there is a problem with the installed components, you need to re-engraving the disk after adjustment and release.So in order to solve this problem.In the new version, we support directly changing the component build source of the app store to mirror or source code.for quick self-testing and delivery.也就是说，如果我安装下来一个应用，想要替换其中的某个组件时，往往只能新建一个组件，重新编排依赖关系。操作较繁琐。尤其是在离线环境，发现安装的组件有问题时，调整后再发布，往往还需要再次刻盘。因此为了解决这种问题。在新版本中，我们支持直接将应用商店的组件构建源更改为镜像或者源码。以便于快速自测和交付。

### 6. Components that support the creation of job types (Job/CronJob)

In the new version, our component deployment type, on the basis of stateless components and stateful components, has been extended to two types, task (Job) and periodic task (CronJob). Now if you need to create a one-time task, It can be modified by changing the component deployment type.
