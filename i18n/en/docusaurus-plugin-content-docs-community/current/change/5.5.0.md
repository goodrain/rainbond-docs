## Version Changes (5.4.0-5.5.0)

## Interpretation of main function points：

### 1. Support Istio, and support to extend the third-party ServiceMesh framework

Rainbond focuses on non-intrusive, loosely coupled design concepts.In the current version, Rainbond introduces the switching function of application-level governance mode, which realizes the dynamic switching of service governance capabilities without business logic changes, and provides different governance capabilities for the business.Third-party ServcieMesh frameworks, such as Istio, Linkerd, Dapr, etc., can be extended through application-level plug-ins. This time, we have given priority to supporting Istio. Users can install Istio-related components through helm to switch application governance modes.In this way, you can enjoy the governance capabilities related to Istio.as shown below：

We hope that when users finally use it, the service governance capabilities and business logic are completely decoupled, and users can use different governance capabilities according to different businesses.You can expand different governance modes according to your own needs. We will have a special article to introduce in detail how to expand the third-party ServiceMesh framework.

### 2. Compatible with kubernetes management commands and third-party management platforms

In previous versions, we were application-centric, allowing users to easily manage their business.However, using UUID through the namespace, application name, and service name generated by Rainbond is very unfriendly to those who are familiar with Kubernetes. The ID displayed in Kubernetes cannot be associated with the business, so it cannot be managed using Kubernetes commands or Kubernetes third-party tools.Therefore, we now support the renaming of various resources in the cluster.Users can customize the English names of teams, applications, services, components, and images, which will be displayed in English in Kubernetes.

The user sets the English name of the application rbd, and after setting the English name of the component respectively, the resources generated in the cluster are shown in the following figure.
