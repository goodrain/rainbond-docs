## Version Changes (5.4.0-5.5.0)

## Interpretation of main function points：

### 1. Support Istio, and support to extend the third-party ServiceMesh framework

Rainbond 专注于无侵入，松耦合的设计理念。在当前版本中，Rainbond 引入了应用级治理模式的切换功能，实现了服务治理能力的动态切换，无需业务逻辑变更，为业务提供了不同的治理能力。可以通过应用级插件的形式扩展第三方 ServcieMesh 框架，比如 Istio、Linkerd、Dapr 等，本次我们优先支持了Istio，用户可以通过 helm 安装 Istio 相关组件，实现应用治理模式的切换。从而享受到Istio相关的治理能力。如下图所示：

We hope that when users finally use it, the service governance capabilities and business logic are completely decoupled, and users can use different governance capabilities according to different businesses.You can expand different governance modes according to your own needs. We will have a special article to introduce in detail how to expand the third-party ServiceMesh framework.可以根据自己的需要扩展不同的治理模式，后续我们会有专门的文章来详细介绍如何扩展第三方 ServiceMesh 框架。

### 2. Compatible with kubernetes management commands and third-party management platforms

在之前的版本中，我们以应用为中心，使用户可以便捷的管理自己的业务。但通过Rainbond生成的名字空间、应用名和服务名使用 UUID，对熟悉 Kubernetes 的人非常不友好，在 Kubernetes 展示的 ID 无法跟业务关联，就无法使用 Kubernetes 命令或 Kubernetes 的第三方工具管理。因此我们现在支持了集群内各类资源的重命名。用户可以自定义团队、应用、服务、组件、镜像的英文名，在Kubernetes 中会以英文名展示。

The user sets the English name of the application rbd, and after setting the English name of the component respectively, the resources generated in the cluster are shown in the following figure.
