#### Difference from IaaS

> Rainbond is a cloud-native PaaS platform in the field of cloud computing, which supports privatized deployment in any cluster environment, including physical machines, virtual machines, and cloud servers. At the same time, Haoyu Technology provides Rainbond + Alibaba Cloud IaaS (Hangzhou + Shanghai) public cloud services to facilitate technology enthusiasts to quickly experience Rainbond products, allowing you to experience a different development, operation and maintenance experience from directly connecting to IaaS. 同时，好雨科技为了方便技术爱好者快速体验 Rainbond 产品，提供 Rainbond+阿里云 IaaS（杭州+上海）的公有云服务，让您感受到与直接对接 IaaS 不一样的开发运维体验。

#### The difference and advantage comparison with Rancher KubeSphere

> Both Rancher and KubeSphere are mainly abstract management platforms at the container level, which can be understood as the UI interface for container management.Users are required to have a strong ability to control container technology and conduct development, operation and maintenance operations at the container level. Rainbond is an abstract management platform at the application level. It is application-centric and does not require users to learn container technology to enjoy the value brought by container technology!If you need to perform container-level operations, Rainbond also provides a form of web shell to meet your needs.需要用户对容器技术有很强的掌控能力，在容器级别进行开发运维操作。
> Rainbond 是应用级别抽象的管理平台，以应用为中心，不需要用户学习容器技术，即可享受容器技术带来的价值！如果您需要进行容器级别的操作，同时 Rainbond 还提供 web shell 的形式，满足您的使用需求。

#### Whether the bottom layer is container technology and what does it have to do with Docker and K8s?

> The bottom layer of Rainbond uses container technology (Docker+K8s), V3.7.2 and previous versions, and uses the magic-modified K8s and Docker to help users avoid pitfalls and avoid repeated wheel building. V5.0 and subsequent versions support the community version of K8s and Docker to help users better transition to using Rainbond as a DevOps platform for the entire application life cycle.
