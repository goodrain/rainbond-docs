## Rainbond cluster-side source code compilation

The data center side is directly deployed on the Kubernetes cluster and has many components, so you can compile individual components as needed.

## single component compilation

Single-component compilation is very important in the actual development process. Due to the relatively large system of the Rainbond system, in the usual development process, a component is usually modified and then compiled, and the latest component image is used in the installed development and test environment. directly replace the image in the .

Single component compilation supports the following componentsï¼š

## The compilation method is as followsï¼š

(1) Clone project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/goodrain/rainbond.git
```

(2) Take the chaos component as an example, execute it in the main directory of the rainbond code

```bash
./release.sh chaos
```

## The complete installation package is packaged and compiled

Compiling the complete installation package is suitable for regenerating the installation package after changing a lot of source code.Execute in the main directory of the rainbond codeExecute in rainbond code home directory

```
./release.sh all
```

## Running data center side mirroring

Since the data center is deployed on the Kubernetes cluster, you need to meet the following prerequisites to run the compiled component image.

### Preconditions

1. Rainbond's test environment has been installed
2. Kubectl command

### run image

The components on the data center side of Rainbond are all defined by the CRD resource rbdcomponent.Therefore, when you compile the image of a component and need to run it, you need to modify the rbdcomponent resource.So when you compile a mirror of a component that needs to be running, you need to modify the rbdcomponent resource.

Still take the chaos component as an example.Suppose your compiled chaos image is namedAssume your compiled chaos mirror is named

```Bash
rainbond/rbd-chaos:v5.5.0-release
```

Then you need to do the following in order to replace the component images in your cluster.

(1) Edit the corresponding rbdcomponent file

```Bash
kubtl edit rbdcomponent rbd-chaos -n rbd-system
```

(2) Find the mirror address column and modify it to your mirror, such as

```Bash
image: rainbond/rbd-chaos:v5.5.0-release
imagPolicy: IfNotPresent
```

(3) Save and exit, execute the following command at this time, you should see that the corresponding component is being updated.Just wait for the pod to update.Wait until the pod update is complete.

```Bash
kubtl get po -n rbd-system
```
